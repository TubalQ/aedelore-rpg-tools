WORLD OF ASHENDOR — GEOGRAPHIC REFERENCE

The continent of Ashendor stretches north to south, bordered by ocean on west, north, and east. The south opens to a vast sea.

=== REGIONS (North to South) ===

THORSHEIM (Far North): Colossal impassable snow-covered mountain range spanning the entire northern edge. The Dragon Gods sleep here. Nothing civilized exists beyond.

BRIGHTWOODS (Northwest): Vast dark corrupted forest under Thorsheim. Dangerous, untamed wilderness filled with dark forces. The Sunken City lies at its southern end.

MOUNT BASIN (North-Central): Mountainous area directly below the Great Tree of Morningstar. Forms the natural border between Westfall (west) and Eastwatch (east).

BOREA (Northeast): Frozen mountainous region under Thorsheim. Snow and ice year-round. Dwarven homeland. A prominent waterfall cascades down the eastern mountains to the coast.

WESTFALL (West): Western half of the continent south of Brightwoods. Farmland, forests, coast. Generally peaceful. Temperate climate.

EASTWATCH (East): Eastern half south of Borea. Forests, farmland, eastern coast. A bay with islands separates it from Northern Marches to the south. Temperate.

NORTHERN MARCHES (Central): Border zone between Westfall and Eastwatch. Transitional landscape. Temperate.

ALFWYLD FOREST (Northern Eastwatch): Ancient forest at the edge of southern Mount Basin. Halfling homeland. Lush and warm.

ARFALIA (South): Southern continent below Northern Marches. Mountain ranges in the north (Lorenzia), coastal plains, and the Ivory Bogs in the southwest. Mediterranean climate in the south.

THE IVORY BOGS (SW Arfalia): Wetland/bog region near the southwestern coast. Home to Feldale and Varrow.

THE BURNING PASSAGE (Southwest): Volcanic scorched region. Orange and red terrain with active volcanoes. Hot, dry, desolate, uninhabited.

ORCISH TERRITORY (Far East): Islands east of Fort Salinax. Orc and troll domains beyond the sea.

=== MAJOR LANDMARKS ===

THE GREAT TREE OF MORNINGSTAR: Enormous sacred tree in north-central Ashendor, between Brightwoods and Borea, south of Thorsheim. Visible from great distances. Spiritual reference point.

THE SUNKEN CITY: Cursed ruins of an ancient elven metropolis in southern Brightwoods. Once ruled by King Malcath, who was consumed by dark ambition. Mist-shrouded, haunted. Serexa Fortress watches over it.

THE FLOATING ISLES: Enchanted islands suspended in the sky above the southwestern sea, west of Fall of the First Heroes. Born from the First War's magic. Sacred to elves — temples and libraries built upon them.

FALL OF THE FIRST HEROES: Historic site north of Nortaq, east of the Burning Passage. Tied to the First War.

THE OLD BRIDGE: Bridge near Lutovia crossing the river that flows from the Sunken City southward to Feldale.

BROKEN BRIDGE: Near Serexa Fortress, connecting toward Brightwoods.

THE BARROWHILLS: Hills at Mount Basin's foot, east of Castle Black.

=== MAJOR RIVER ===
A significant river flows from the Sunken City southward through the continent, passing the Old Bridge near Lutovia, continuing down to the Ivory Bogs and Feldale. Another river flows through East Trade to the eastern sea.
