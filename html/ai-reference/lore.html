<h2>The Void</h2>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Nature of the Void</h3>
<p>What follows is not meant for the uninitiated, for to understand the Void is to glimpse that which exists beyond the boundaries of sanity. These words have been gathered from the ravings of those who peered too deeply, the testimonies of Void-touched survivors, and the ancient warnings left by the Dragon Gods themselves. Read with caution, for knowledge of the darkness carries its own weight.</p>
<p>- Compiled by the Conclave of Wardens, guardians of the seals that hold back the hungering dark</p>
<p>The Nature of Nothingness</p>
<p>Know then that the Void is not merely empty space, not simply the absence of light or matter. The Void is active nothingness-a hunger given form, an emptiness that desires to consume all that exists and return creation to the primordial state before the Black Sun first sparked with divine fire.</p>
<p>For it is written in the oldest texts: before creation, there was only the Void. And the Void remembers. It remembers when it was all that existed, when no light dared intrude upon its perfect darkness, when no life disturbed its eternal silence. The Void does not hate creation-hatred requires passion, and the Void is beyond such things. The Void simply hungers for what was taken from it: everything.</p>
<p>The Absence That Thinks</p>
<p>What makes the Void truly terrible is not its emptiness but its awareness. The Void is conscious in a way that mortal minds cannot comprehend-not a single entity but a vast, diffuse intelligence that permeates all darkness, that lurks in every shadow, that waits in the spaces between stars.</p>
<p>This consciousness does not think as mortals think. It does not plan or scheme in ways we would recognize. Instead, it yearns. It reaches. It whispers to those who might serve as doorways for its return. Every shadow cast by every candle contains a fragment of this awareness, watching, waiting, remembering.</p>
<p>Let those who walk in darkness understand: the darkness is never empty. Something is always watching from within it.</p>
<p>The Relationship with Zelgor</p>
<p>Many confuse Zelgor, the Harbinger of Shadows, with the Void itself. This is understandable but incorrect. Zelgor is of the Void-its firstborn champion, its avatar in the realm of form-but he is not the Void entire.</p>
<p>Think of it thus: if the Void is an ocean, Zelgor is the wave that crashes upon the shore. He is the Void&#x27;&#x27;s will given shape, its hunger given teeth, its darkness given purpose. When the Dragon Gods drove Zelgor back in the Grand Battle, they did not defeat the Void-they merely pushed back its most powerful manifestation.</p>
<p>The Void remains. It always remains. And through cracks and tears in the fabric of reality, through corrupted souls and forbidden rituals, it continues to seep into Aedelore, patient as entropy, eternal as ending.</p>
<p>Why the Void Cannot Be Destroyed</p>
<p>For it is written: you cannot destroy nothingness, for nothingness is the absence of destruction as much as it is the absence of creation. The Void exists as a fundamental principle of reality-the counterbalance to existence itself.</p>
<p>Without the Void, there would be no boundary to define where creation ends. Without darkness, light would have no meaning. The Dragon Gods understood this truth in the aftermath of the Grand Battle: the Void cannot be eliminated, only contained. Their eternal vigilance is not a temporary measure but a permanent necessity-a war without end, fought so that existence itself might continue.</p>
<p>This is the burden the gods bear, and this is the truth they have passed to their faithful: the darkness will never be conquered. It can only be held at bay, generation after generation, until the stars themselves grow cold.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>Void Corruption</h3>
<p>This document was written as a warning, sealed by the Conclave of Wardens, and placed in the restricted archives of every major temple in Aedelore. It describes how the Void claims souls-not through conquest but through corruption. May those who read it recognize the signs before it is too late.</p>
<p>- Set down by Warden-Commander Aldris Voidbane, who witnessed the fall of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call and survived to tell the tale</p>
<p>The Stages of Corruption</p>
<p>Know then that the Void does not conquer through force alone. Its true weapon is corruption-the slow, patient unmaking of all that a soul once was, until nothing remains but a hollow vessel for the darkness to fill.</p>
<p>Void corruption progresses through stages, each more terrible than the last:</p>
<p>The Whisper - It begins with thoughts that seem to come from nowhere. Doubts about loved ones. Suspicions without cause. A growing certainty that the world is fundamentally wrong, that something essential is missing. The afflicted often do not recognize these thoughts as foreign; they believe them to be their own insights, their own awakening to hidden truths.</p>
<p>The Hunger - Next comes a desire that cannot be satisfied. It may manifest as greed, as ambition, as lust for power or knowledge. Whatever form it takes, it grows until it consumes all other concerns. The afflicted begin to sacrifice relationships, principles, and eventually their very humanity in pursuit of this hunger that can never be filled.</p>
<p>The Seeing - In this stage, the afflicted begin to perceive the Void directly. They see shadows move when nothing moves. They hear whispers in silence. They feel presences in empty rooms. Many go mad at this stage; those who do not become convinced that they have been granted special insight, that they alone understand the true nature of reality.</p>
<p>The Turning - The final stage, from which there is no return. The soul becomes a gateway, a crack through which the Void can seep into reality. The body may continue to function, but the person who once inhabited it is gone, replaced by something that wears their face and speaks with their voice but serves only the hunger of the endless dark.</p>
<p>Vectors of Corruption</p>
<p>The Void cannot simply reach into a healthy soul. It requires a point of entry-a moment of weakness, a crack in the spirit through which its influence can flow. The most common vectors include:</p>
<p>Forbidden Knowledge - Certain texts and rituals deliberately open the reader to Void influence. The Conclave of Wardens maintains lists of such materials, but new ones are always being discovered or created.</p>
<p>Void-Touched Objects - Items that have been exposed to concentrated Void energy can carry corruption like a disease. The cursed artifacts of fallen civilizations are particularly dangerous.</p>
<p>Proximity to Breaches - Where the boundary between reality and Void has worn thin, mere presence can begin the corruption process. The ruins of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call are such a place.</p>
<p>Emotional Devastation - Grief, rage, despair-these create cracks in the soul through which the Void&#x27;&#x27;s whispers can enter. Those who have suffered great trauma are especially vulnerable.</p>
<p>Signs of the Afflicted</p>
<p>For it is written: know your enemy by the marks they leave upon their servants. Those corrupted by the Void often display certain signs:</p>
<p>Their shadows move wrongly, sometimes a heartbeat behind their movements, sometimes reaching toward light sources rather than away. Their eyes, in certain lights, seem to contain depths that go too far, as if something vast lurks behind them. They speak of &quot;understanding&quot; and &quot;seeing clearly&quot; while their actions grow increasingly destructive. They cannot bear the presence of sacred flames, particularly those consecrated to Taninsam.</p>
<p>Let those who recognize these signs act swiftly, for in the early stages, corruption can still be cleansed. But once the Turning is complete, only mercy remains-the mercy of a swift end, before the corrupted soul can spread its darkness further.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Boundary</h3>
<p>The Boundary is not a place that can be found on any map, yet it exists everywhere-the thin membrane between what is and what is not, between creation and the emptiness that hungers to unmake it. What follows describes this liminal space and the places where it has worn thin.</p>
<p>- From the lectures of Archweaver Sylas, Master of Protective Wards, delivered to initiates of the Arcane Creed</p>
<p>The Nature of the Boundary</p>
<p>Know then that reality is not infinite. It has edges, borders, places where existence simply stops. Beyond these borders lies the Void, pressing eternally against the walls of creation, seeking any crack through which it might seep.</p>
<p>The Boundary is not a wall built by mortal hands. It is the natural membrane that formed when the Dragon Gods first shaped Aedelore from chaos-a consequence of creation itself. Where there is something, there must be a line beyond which there is nothing. The Boundary is that line.</p>
<p>In most places, the Boundary is strong, reinforced by the living faith of mortals and the watchful presence of the divine. But in some locations, it has worn thin. In others, it has torn entirely.</p>
<p>The Thin Places</p>
<p>Certain locations in Aedelore exist closer to the Void than others. In these thin places, the laws of reality grow... uncertain. Shadows behave strangely. Sounds echo from distances that should not exist. Those with sensitivity to magic report feelings of pressure, as if something vast presses against an invisible barrier.</p>
<p>The known thin places include:</p>
<p>The Depths of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call - Where the Dwarves delved too deep and broke through into something that should have remained sealed. The lower levels are now abandoned, and the boundary there is thin enough that Void entities have been known to manifest.</p>
<p>The Lake of Shadows - Above the Sunken City, where Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s fall created a permanent wound in reality. The waters are said to reflect not the sky above but something else entirely.</p>
<p>The Frozen Wastes of Borea - Where Nyxora once tried to establish a permanent foothold and was driven back by Tatsu and Leviathan. The cold there is not merely physical; it is the cold of the Void itself, bleeding through.</p>
<p>The Heart of Brightwood - Where Taninsam and Zelgor fought their greatest battle. Though the forest has regrown, the spiritual scars remain, and the boundary there shifts like an open wound.</p>
<p>Tears in Reality</p>
<p>Worse than thin places are tears-locations where the Boundary has actually ruptured, creating permanent gateways between Aedelore and the Void. These are rare, for the Dragon Gods work constantly to seal them, but some persist:</p>
<p>For it is written: where a tear exists, the Void does not merely influence-it enters. Void creatures emerge from such places, not as corrupted mortals but as beings of pure nothingness given form. The land around tears dies, corrupted beyond any hope of restoration.</p>
<p>The greatest known tear lies sealed beneath Thorsheim itself, watched eternally by the Dragon Gods in their long slumber. It was this tear through which Zelgor first entered creation, and it was driving him back through this tear that ended the Grand Battle. The seal holds, maintained by divine power that has not wavered in all the ages since-but those who guard it know that even divine power is not infinite.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Boundary</p>
<p>The Boundary can be reinforced through faith, through magic, and through the presence of divine artifacts. This is why temples dot the landscape of Aedelore, why the Arcane Creed maintains wards at strategic locations, why the faithful are taught to pray: every act of belief in the light weakens the Void&#x27;&#x27;s grip upon reality.</p>
<p>Conversely, every loss of faith, every act of despair, every forbidden ritual strengthens the Void&#x27;&#x27;s position. The war for Aedelore is fought not only with swords and spells but with the hearts and minds of every mortal being. Each soul that turns to hope is a brick in the wall. Each soul that falls to corruption is a crack.</p>
<p>This is why the darkness can never truly be defeated, and why the light must never stop fighting.</p>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>Entities of the Void</h3>
<p>Beyond Zelgor and his consort Nyxora, other entities dwell within or emerge from the Void. This catalogue, incomplete though it must be, describes the known classifications of Void beings. May this knowledge serve as warning, not invitation.</p>
<p>- From the Bestiary of Darkness, maintained by the Conclave of Wardens across generations of vigilance</p>
<p>The Hierarchy of the Void</p>
<p>Know then that the Void, though it may seem formless chaos, possesses a terrible order. Its denizens exist in a hierarchy of power, from the mindless hunger of the least to the calculating malevolence of the greatest.</p>
<p>The Firstborn: Zelgor and His Court</p>
<p>At the apex stands Zelgor himself, the Harbinger of Shadows, firstborn of the Void and its mightiest champion. Though driven back in the Grand Battle, he remains, waiting in the darkness between stars for the moment when he might return.</p>
<p>Beneath him stands Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen, whom Zelgor created from his own essence to serve as consort and general. Unlike Zelgor, Nyxora has walked Aedelore, has touched its soil and tasted its corruption. Her understanding of mortal weakness makes her perhaps more dangerous than her creator.</p>
<p>Zarathen, the Whisperer in the Void, holds a position apart-neither servant nor equal, but something older, something that existed in the Void before even Zelgor took form. Zarathen does not command armies or seek conquest. He corrupts. He whispers. He was the voice that turned Malcath from king to monster, and countless others before and since.</p>
<p>The Void Lords</p>
<p>Below the Firstborn exist entities of terrible power-not gods, but something close. These Void Lords were once creatures of other realities, consumed and remade by the Void into instruments of its will. Each commands legions of lesser entities, each seeks to expand the Void&#x27;&#x27;s dominion in their own way.</p>
<p>Their names are not spoken aloud, for names have power, and to speak the name of a Void Lord is to draw its attention. The Wardens know these names, guard them, use them only in the most desperate of bindings and banishments.</p>
<p>The Void-Spawned</p>
<p>These are beings that formed spontaneously from the Void itself-not corrupted mortals but creatures of pure nothingness given shape by hunger. They include:</p>
<p>Shadow Stalkers - Predators that exist in the space between shadows, emerging only to feed on the life force of the living. They leave no corpse, only absence.</p>
<p>Void Wraiths - The echoes of souls that were not merely corrupted but entirely consumed by the Void, now serving as scouts and heralds for greater entities.</p>
<p>Entropy Weavers - Entities that exist to unmake, dissolving matter and magic alike into raw nothingness. Where they pass, reality itself grows thin.</p>
<p>The Formless - Masses of pure Void-stuff that have not yet coalesced into specific shapes. They are the most numerous and the least intelligent, but in sufficient numbers, they can overwhelm any defense.</p>
<p>The Void-Touched</p>
<p>Distinct from true Void entities are those mortals who have been corrupted but not entirely consumed. These Void-touched retain their mortal forms but serve the Void&#x27;&#x27;s purposes, often without fully understanding what they have become.</p>
<p>For it is written: the most dangerous servant of darkness is the one who believes they still serve the light. The Void-touched often continue their mortal lives, spreading corruption through word and deed, weakening the Boundary through their very existence.</p>
<p>Some, like Malcath before his final fall, retain enough of their former selves to suffer-to know what they have become and be unable to stop it. These are perhaps the most tragic, and the most dangerous, for their despair feeds the very darkness that consumes them.</p>
<p>A Final Warning</p>
<p>Let none who read this catalogue think themselves prepared to face such entities. Knowledge is the first defense, but it is not sufficient. The Void&#x27;&#x27;s servants are ancient beyond mortal comprehension, patient beyond mortal endurance, and hungry beyond mortal understanding.</p>
<p>When you face the Void, you do not face an enemy. You face the end of all things, given form and purpose. Fight it nonetheless-for what else can those who love the light do?-but never imagine that you fight something that can be truly understood or permanently defeated.</p>
<p>The war is eternal. The best we can do is ensure that we are not the generation in which it is lost.</p>

<h2>Elarion - The Lost World</h2>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Memory of Elarion</h3>
<p>What follows is a reconstruction of memory-fragments gathered from the dreams of the eldest Elves, from songs that have been sung since before Aedelore had a name, and from the few relics that survived the crossing. Elarion cannot be visited, cannot be verified, cannot be truly known. It can only be remembered, and even memory fades.</p>
<p>- Compiled by Lorekeeper Aelindra of House Lorendel, from the Scrolls of Exile, in the hope that what is remembered can never be entirely lost</p>
<p>A World Before This World</p>
<p>Know then that the Elves of Aedelore are not natives to this land. Before the first stone of Lorenzia was laid, before the forests of Rivermount knew the touch of Elven hands, before Aedelore itself was more than a dream in the minds of gods-there was Elarion.</p>
<p>Elarion was a world of twin suns, one of gold and one of silver, whose light mingled in the sky to create colors that have no names in any tongue spoken today. The cities of Elarion rose in spirals toward the heavens, grown rather than built, shaped by magic so refined that stone and crystal flowed like water at the command of the Weavers.</p>
<p>For it is written in the oldest songs: Elarion was not merely a place. It was a promise. A world where the Elves had evolved over countless millennia, where magic and nature existed in perfect harmony, where the Void was nothing but a distant whisper beyond the stars.</p>
<p>The Golden Age</p>
<p>The Elves of Elarion lived for millennia without war, without want, without the shadow that would eventually consume them. They pursued art and knowledge, music and magic, philosophy and the cultivation of the spirit. Their libraries contained the wisdom of ages; their gardens bloomed with flowers that have no equivalent in Aedelore.</p>
<p>They had mastered the Weave in ways that even Tohu&#x27;&#x27;s faithful cannot replicate today. They could reshape reality with a thought, traverse vast distances in a single step, extend their already-long lives to spans that made even immortality seem brief. Some say the greatest of the Elarion Weavers could glimpse the threads of fate itself.</p>
<p>And yet, for all their power, they did not see the darkness coming until it was too late.</p>
<p>The Coming of the Shadow</p>
<p>How the Void found Elarion, no one knows. Perhaps their great magic created ripples that attracted its attention. Perhaps some Weaver delved too deep into mysteries best left unexplored. Perhaps the Void simply reaches all worlds eventually, given sufficient time.</p>
<p>It began with whispers. Strange dreams. A growing sense of unease that the philosophers could not explain and the Weavers could not dispel. Then came the first Void-touched-Elves whose eyes held depths that should not exist, whose shadows moved wrongly, who spoke of &quot;understanding&quot; with smiles that held no warmth.</p>
<p>By the time the true nature of the threat was recognized, the corruption had spread too far to contain. The Void had found purchase in Elarion, and it was hungry.</p>
<p>The Final Days</p>
<p>The war for Elarion lasted three hundred years by the counting of that world-a mere heartbeat in the life of an immortal race, yet long enough to see everything they had built begin to crumble. The twin suns themselves began to dim as the Void spread across the sky, consuming light, consuming hope, consuming all that Elarion had been.</p>
<p>In the end, the greatest Weavers made a terrible choice. They could not save their world, but they could save their people-or some of them. Using magic that burned out their own souls in the casting, they tore open a pathway through the Void itself, a bridge to a world that Zelgor had not yet touched.</p>
<p>They called it the Crossing, and it was the end of Elarion and the beginning of the Elves&#x27;&#x27; new chapter in Aedelore.</p>
<p>What Was Lost</p>
<p>For it is written: to speak of what was lost is to court despair, yet to forget is to betray those who sacrificed everything.</p>
<p>The libraries of Elarion-a million years of accumulated knowledge-burned or were swallowed by the Void. The gardens, the crystal spires, the great works of art that had no equal-all gone. Most of the population, those who could not reach the portal ships in time, remained behind to face the darkness.</p>
<p>But perhaps the greatest loss was innocence itself. The Elves who fled Elarion left behind the belief that evil could be defeated, that light would always triumph, that their mastery of magic made them safe. They arrived in Aedelore as refugees, humbled, traumatized, carrying within them the knowledge that the Void could find any world, consume any civilization, end any story.</p>
<p>This is why the Elves guard Aedelore so fiercely. This is why they watch the shadows with eyes that never rest. They know, in a way that no other race can know, what happens when the Void is underestimated.</p>
<p>They have seen it. They have survived it. And they will do anything to ensure that Aedelore does not share Elarion&#x27;&#x27;s fate.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Crossing</h3>
<p>The Crossing was not a journey. It was a wound-torn through the fabric of reality by Weavers who sacrificed themselves so that others might live. This account preserves what is known of those terrible days, gathered from the testimonies of survivors and the visions of those who still dream of the path between worlds.</p>
<p>- From the Chronicles of Exile, maintained by the Keepers of Memory in the Great Library of Lorenzia</p>
<p>The Decision</p>
<p>When the Council of Weavers convened for the last time, the twin suns of Elarion had already begun to fade. The Void covered half the sky, a spreading stain of absolute darkness that swallowed stars as it grew. The great cities lay in ruins or corruption. The armies of the Void-touched marched through lands that had never known war.</p>
<p>The greatest Weavers proposed an impossible solution: they would tear a hole in reality itself, create a bridge to another world, lead as many of their people to safety as they could. The cost would be their lives, their very souls consumed by the magic required.</p>
<p>Know then that they did not hesitate. The thirty-three greatest Weavers of Elarion agreed without debate, without tears, without farewell. They had lived long lives. They had seen their world die. They would spend the last of themselves to ensure their people did not die with it.</p>
<p>The Portal Ships</p>
<p>In the final days, the Elves built vessels unlike any that had existed before-ships designed not to sail water or air but to traverse the space between worlds. They were grown from the heartwood of the World Trees of Elarion, the last of their kind, shaped by magic and desperation into arks that could carry thousands.</p>
<p>Twelve ships were completed before time ran out. Twelve ships, for a civilization of millions.</p>
<p>The loading was chaotic, desperate, heartbreaking. Families were separated. Ancient treasures were abandoned. The libraries burned as scholars tried to save what could be carried. The Void-touched hammered at the gates of the last refuge while, inside, the Weavers began their final working.</p>
<p>The Tearing</p>
<p>For it is written: the Crossing was not opened-it was ripped. The thirty-three Weavers joined their power in a working that had never been attempted, that violated laws of reality they themselves had once considered sacred. They reached through the Void itself, searching for a world untouched by corruption, a place where their people might begin again.</p>
<p>They found Aedelore.</p>
<p>The portal that formed was not stable, not safe, not controlled. It was a wound in the universe, held open by the burning souls of the greatest mages Elarion had ever produced. Through it, the survivors could see a sky with a single yellow sun, a world of green and blue, a place where the Void had not yet reached.</p>
<p>The ships launched into that impossible passage, and behind them, one by one, the Weavers died-their souls consumed, their bodies falling empty as the magic took everything they had.</p>
<p>The Passage</p>
<p>Those who survived the Crossing speak of it only rarely, and only in whispers. The passage through the Void was not a journey through darkness-it was a journey through awareness. The Void knew they were passing through its domain. It reached for them. It whispered to them. It showed them visions of despair, of Elarion&#x27;&#x27;s final moments, of futures in which Aedelore too would fall.</p>
<p>Some who made the Crossing never fully recovered. Their minds touched the Void, and though their bodies arrived safely, something essential was left behind. These became the First Mourners, those who could no longer experience joy, whose eyes forever held the reflection of what they had witnessed.</p>
<p>But most survived intact, if changed. They emerged into the skies above Aedelore, their ships battered but whole, their people alive, their world lost forever but their hope-somehow-preserved.</p>
<p>The Arrival</p>
<p>When the portal ships descended through Aedelore&#x27;&#x27;s clouds, they found a world already inhabited by the Dragon Gods, already shaped by divine will, already claimed. The Elves came not as conquerors but as refugees, bearing the weight of a lost civilization and the desperate need for a new home.</p>
<p>The Dragon Gods, who had themselves fought the Void in the Grand Battle, recognized the shadow in the Elves&#x27;&#x27; eyes. They understood what these beings had fled from and what they carried with them. And so, in the first act of alliance between gods and mortals, they offered sanctuary.</p>
<p>The Elves could stay. They could build. They could heal.</p>
<p>But they must also watch. They must stand as guardians against the darkness that had consumed their home. They must ensure that what happened to Elarion would never happen to Aedelore.</p>
<p>This covenant has never been broken. The Elves remember, and in remembering, they keep faith with those who died so that they might live.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>Relics of a Lost World</h3>
<p>Not everything was lost in the Crossing. Fragments of Elarion survived-relics carried by refugees, artifacts hidden in the holds of portal ships, memories preserved in crystal and song. These remnants are sacred to the Elven people, tangible links to a past that can never be reclaimed.</p>
<p>- Catalogued by Curator Thessaly of the House of Memory, Lorenzia</p>
<p>The Surviving Relics</p>
<p>Know then that Elarion&#x27;&#x27;s relics are not mere objects. They are the only physical proof that an entire world once existed-a world of beauty and magic now swallowed by absolute darkness. To hold an Elarion relic is to touch history that predates Aedelore itself.</p>
<p>The Starlight Crystals</p>
<p>These crystals, harvested from the peaks of Elarion&#x27;&#x27;s highest mountains, still contain light from the twin suns that no longer shine. They glow with a soft luminescence that combines gold and silver, a color that exists nowhere else in creation. The Elves use them sparingly in their most sacred rituals, knowing that when the last crystal dims, the last physical light of Elarion will be gone forever.</p>
<p>Approximately thirty-seven Starlight Crystals are known to exist. They are held in the vaults of Lorenzia, brought out only on the Day of Remembrance when the Elves gather to mourn what was lost.</p>
<p>The Memory Stones</p>
<p>These small, smooth stones were created by the Weavers of Elarion as repositories for memories too precious to trust to mortal minds alone. By touching a Memory Stone and focusing one&#x27;&#x27;s thoughts, an Elf can experience the memory recorded within-not as a story told, but as a moment relived.</p>
<p>Some Memory Stones contain beautiful scenes: the view from the Crystal Spire at sunset, the sound of the Eternal Choir, the taste of fruits that will never grow again. Others contain darker memories: the first appearance of the Void-touched, the fall of great cities, the final moments of loved ones left behind.</p>
<p>The Keepers of Memory determine which stones may be experienced and by whom. Some memories, they say, are too painful to share with any but the strongest minds.</p>
<p>The Fragments of the World Trees</p>
<p>The portal ships themselves were grown from the heartwood of Elarion&#x27;&#x27;s World Trees-ancient beings of immense power that had stood since the dawn of Elven civilization. When the ships reached Aedelore and could fly no more, they were carefully dismantled, their wood preserved as sacred relics.</p>
<p>Fragments of World Tree wood can still channel magic with an efficiency that modern artificers cannot replicate. The staffs of the Arcane Creed&#x27;&#x27;s greatest mages often contain slivers of this wood at their cores. It is said that World Tree wood remembers the Weave as it was in Elarion-purer, stronger, uncorrupted by the Void&#x27;&#x27;s touch.</p>
<p>The Sealed Archives</p>
<p>Not all that was carried from Elarion is meant to be seen. In the deepest vaults beneath Lorenzia, behind wards maintained by the greatest Weavers of each generation, lie the Sealed Archives-texts and artifacts deemed too dangerous to be released.</p>
<p>For it is written: some knowledge was the very thing that attracted the Void&#x27;&#x27;s attention. The Elves do not know which discoveries led to their world&#x27;&#x27;s doom, and so they seal away anything that might repeat the mistake.</p>
<p>What lies in those vaults, only the Council of Memory knows. And they have sworn never to tell.</p>
<p>Living Relics</p>
<p>Perhaps the most precious relics of Elarion are not objects at all, but the eldest Elves themselves-those few who were alive before the Crossing, who saw Elarion with their own eyes, who remember the twin suns and the crystal cities and the world that was.</p>
<p>These ancients grow fewer with each passing century. Even Elven immortality has its limits, and the trauma of the Crossing took its toll. When the last Elarion-born Elf passes, the last living connection to that lost world will be severed forever.</p>
<p>This is why the Elves record, remember, and preserve. The relics are precious, but they are only echoes. True memory lives in those who experienced it-and true memory is fading, year by year, as the survivors of Elarion slowly join the world they lost.</p>

<h3>Siege of Embersail</h3>
<p>Hear now the tale of Embersail, for it teaches that the mightiest walls are not those built of stone, but those built of united hearts. When darkness descends and hope seems distant, know that the light you seek may already dwell within you, waiting only for the moment of need to reveal itself.</p>
<p>- Spoken by the harbor elders on nights when storms gather, preserved by Harbormaster Corwin Waveborn in the year following the siege</p>
<p>In the days when Embersail yet stood proud upon the western shores, its towers gleaming in the dying light of countless sunsets, there came a darkness from the mountains that would test the very soul of its people. For it is written that strength untested is strength unknown, and the measure of a city lies not in its walls but in the hearts that defend them.</p>
<p>The harbor had flourished in peace, its people grown accustomed to the gentle rhythm of trade and tide. Yet the wise among them remembered the old warnings: that prosperity breeds complacency, and complacency opens the door to shadow. These warnings they had spoken, but few had listened-for such is the nature of mortal hearts, to believe that tomorrow will mirror today.</p>
<p>From the distant peaks came the Trolls, united beneath a warlord whose hunger burned hotter than any forge. They sought an artifact of ancient Dwarven craft, a relic of power hidden within Embersail&#x27;&#x27;s foundations since before the city&#x27;&#x27;s first stones were laid. This knowledge had come to them through dark whispers, for secrets buried deep will always find those who seek them with sufficient desire.</p>
<p>Know then that the artifact they sought was no mere treasure. It was a vessel of the earth&#x27;&#x27;s own strength, forged in the age when Dwarves and stone spoke the same tongue. Within it slumbered the power of unity itself-for the Dwarven smiths had understood that the greatest magic lies not in dominion over others, but in the bonds that form when free peoples stand as one.</p>
<p>The Descent of Shadow</p>
<p>When the sun surrendered to night and the moon hid her face in shame, the assault began. The Trolls moved through darkness as fish move through water, for shadow was their element and silence their weapon. The guards upon the walls saw nothing until death was already among them.</p>
<p>Thus does darkness ever approach-not with thunder and proclamation, but with the quiet step of inevitability. Those who watch only for the obvious threat will be consumed by the subtle one.</p>
<p>Panic spread through Embersail like fire through dry timber. The alarm bells sang their desperate song, but what use are warnings when the enemy is already within? The people fled to their homes, barred their doors, and prayed to gods they had neglected in times of plenty.</p>
<p>Yet among the fearful, there arose the resolute. From every corner of the city came those who would not yield-guards and sailors, merchants and craftsmen, the young and the old. They were not warriors by trade, but in that hour, they discovered within themselves a strength they had never known they possessed.</p>
<p>For it is written: the hero is not born but revealed, and the moment of revelation comes only when all other paths have closed.</p>
<p>The Light Within the Stone</p>
<p>Through streets choked with smoke and shadow, a company of the brave made their way toward the ancient ruins at the city&#x27;&#x27;s edge. There, in chambers older than memory, the artifact waited-patient as stone, enduring as hope.</p>
<p>They found it resting upon a pedestal of unmarked granite, its surface carved with runes that seemed to shift and dance in the torchlight. When mortal hands touched it for the first time in ages uncounted, it awakened-not with violence, but with recognition. For the artifact knew its purpose, and it had waited long for those worthy to wield it.</p>
<p>The Trolls came then, bursting through the ancient walls with fury beyond reason. Their warlord stood at their head, his eyes burning with the certainty of victory. He saw only a handful of exhausted defenders clutching a glowing stone, and he laughed-for he did not understand what he faced.</p>
<p>But the artifact knew. And through it, the defenders discovered the truth that had been hidden within them all along: that they were not alone, had never been alone, and would never be alone while they stood together.</p>
<p>Light erupted from the stone-not the cold light of magic, but the warm radiance of united purpose. It formed a barrier that no force of darkness could penetrate, for it was woven from something stronger than any spell: the collective will of those who fight not for glory, but for home.</p>
<p>The Dawn of Understanding</p>
<p>The Trolls broke against that light like waves against a cliff. Again and again they hurled themselves forward, and again and again they were cast back. For all their strength, all their fury, they could not overcome a power they did not comprehend.</p>
<p>When dawn broke over Embersail, the Trolls were gone-fled back to their mountains, their warlord&#x27;&#x27;s roars fading into legend. The city stood battered but unbroken, its people forever changed by what they had learned in that endless night.</p>
<p>The artifact was returned to the Dwarves, for it was their creation and their right. But the true treasure remained with the people of Embersail: the knowledge that unity is not merely a virtue but a power, that the light within can banish even the deepest darkness, and that ordinary souls can accomplish extraordinary deeds when they remember they do not stand alone.</p>
<p>Thus is it taught in the harbor taverns to this day: the walls of Embersail were breached, but the city did not fall. For the truest walls are those we build around each other, and those walls cannot be broken by any force that walks beneath the stars.</p>

<h3>The High Elven Request</h3>
<p>What follows is the account of seeking, for all wisdom must be sought before it can be found. The scrolls retrieved from the depths of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call contained knowledge that had slumbered since before the Age of Silence, and their recovery reminded the world that truth buried is not truth lost-it merely awaits those with courage enough to descend into darkness and bring it back to light.</p>
<p>- Preserved by the Arcane Creed, transcribed by Archweaver Meridian from the testimonies of the four who descended and returned</p>
<p>In the age when magic was returning to Aedelore like spring returning to frozen lands, there arose a need that could not be ignored. The priests of Lorenzia had glimpsed in their meditations a fragment of the old knowledge-wisdom that had been sealed away when Tohu withdrew her gift in grief, now stirring in its ancient resting place.</p>
<p>This knowledge, they understood, held keys to restoring the balance between magic and nature that had been fractured since the First War. But it lay hidden in the depths of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call, that fallen Dwarven kingdom now shrouded in darkness and guarded by forces that had claimed the ruins as their own.</p>
<p>Know then that knowledge hoarded is knowledge corrupted, and truth sealed away from seekers will attract those who would use it for darker purposes. The priests understood that what slumbered in Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call would not sleep forever-and better it be claimed by those who would use it wisely than by those who would twist it to destruction.</p>
<p>Four answered the call, drawn together by fate or purpose or that ineffable force that guides the worthy toward their destiny. They were unlike in origin but united in resolve: Kaelan of the Elves, whose spirit resonated with the Living Weave; Dahlia of the Humans, whose courage burned brighter than any torch; Bran of the Dwarves, whose ancestors had carved the very halls they would enter; and Elysia the scholar, whose understanding of the arcane ran deeper than mere spell-craft.</p>
<p>The Descent Into Memory</p>
<p>The mines of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call had once rung with the songs of industry and the laughter of craftsmen. Now they echoed only with silence and the whisper of things that should not be. Yet even in corruption, traces of the old beauty remained-gemstones glittering in walls of living rock, veins of precious metal catching the torchlight like frozen lightning.</p>
<p>For it is written: darkness may claim a place, but it cannot erase what was created there in light. The essence of purpose lingers, waiting for those who remember how to see it.</p>
<p>Deeper they descended, through passages that remembered Dwarven feet and chambers that had witnessed both triumph and tragedy. Bran walked with tears upon his cheeks, for he was treading in the footsteps of his forebears, and the weight of their loss pressed upon his heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not weep for what was lost,&quot; Kaelan counseled, his voice soft in the darkness. &quot;Weep instead for joy, that we are here to reclaim a portion of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Wisdom speaks in unexpected moments, and those who listen may find comfort where they expected only sorrow.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Guarding</p>
<p>At last they came to a chamber that pulsed with residual power, its crystalline ceiling catching and multiplying what little light they carried until it seemed they stood beneath a sky of frozen stars. In the center, upon a pedestal of ancient stone, rested the chest that held what they had come so far to find.</p>
<p>But the scrolls were not unguarded. As Elysia approached, her fingers trembling with the weight of anticipation, the shadows themselves took form. The guardians rose-not creatures of flesh, but manifestations of the protective magic that the Dwarven sages had woven into this place ages ago.</p>
<p>Know then that true guardians do not distinguish between thief and rightful heir. They challenge all who approach, for worthiness is proven in the proving, not proclaimed beforehand.</p>
<p>Battle was joined in that chamber of crystal and shadow. Bran&#x27;&#x27;s axe sang the songs his ancestors had taught him; Dahlia&#x27;&#x27;s blade carved light into darkness; Kaelan&#x27;&#x27;s magic wove barriers against the shadow-forms; and Elysia, even as she fought, worked to unlock the seals that bound the chest closed.</p>
<p>For those who seek wisdom must be willing to fight for it, and the knowledge most worth having is rarely given freely.</p>
<p>The Return to Light</p>
<p>The chest yielded at last, revealing scrolls bound in leather that glowed with inner light-the preserved wisdom of an age when magic flowed freely and the Dwarves had understood secrets of the Living Weave that even the Elves had forgotten.</p>
<p>With treasure in hand, the four fought their way back toward the surface, pursued by guardians that seemed to multiply with each chamber they passed through. Yet they did not falter, for they carried hope now as well as knowledge, and hope is a burden that lightens rather than weighs.</p>
<p>When at last they emerged into daylight, the sun seemed brighter than it had ever been before. They stood blinking in its radiance, the scrolls clutched close, and they understood that they had done more than retrieve lost knowledge.</p>
<p>They had proven that the darkness which claims abandoned places cannot hold against those who enter with purpose and emerge with unity intact.</p>
<p>The scrolls were carried to Lorenzia, where the priests studied them with reverence and joy. What they learned there aided in the restoration of the old balance, helping to heal the wounds that the Age of Silence had left upon the world.</p>
<p>And the four who had descended into darkness? They remained bound by the experience they had shared, a fellowship forged in shadow and tested in fire. For it is written: those who face death together carry a portion of each other ever after, and such bonds do not break.</p>
<p>Thus does wisdom return to the world-not through grand proclamations, but through the courage of those willing to seek it in the places where it has been buried and forgotten.</p>

<h3>The Guardian and Her Fellowship</h3>
<p>This is the tale of the Wild Spirit&#x27;&#x27;s gathering, when the Guardian who watches over all growing things called forth champions from every people to stand against the corruption of the Void. Let those who hear it understand that nature does not fight alone, and that the wild places remember those who defend them.</p>
<p>- Sung by the druids of the Verdant Heart on the night of the summer solstice, preserved by Archdruid Thornweald in the living memory of the ancient groves</p>
<p>In the age when shadow crept across the land like frost across a windowpane, there came a corruption that threatened the very roots of the world. The Void, that hungry darkness which Zelgor had once commanded, sent tendrils into Aedelore seeking purchase, seeking weakness, seeking entry into the realm of light.</p>
<p>Know then that darkness does not invade with armies alone. Its subtlest assault comes through corruption-the slow poisoning of what is pure, the gradual twisting of what is natural, the patient erosion of boundaries that were meant to stand eternal.</p>
<p>The creatures of the wild sensed it first, for they live closer to the truth of the world than those who dwell in cities of stone. Birds fell silent in their singing; beasts grew restless in their dens; the very trees seemed to shiver though no wind stirred their branches. Something was wrong in the deep places, and the wrongness was spreading.</p>
<p>In the heart of the ancient forest, where Tohu&#x27;&#x27;s magic had given birth to the Wild Spirit in ages past, the Groove Guardian stirred from contemplation. Its amber eyes opened upon a world in peril, and what it saw kindled within it a fierce determination that burned like sunlight through shadow.</p>
<p>The Calling of Champions</p>
<p>The Guardian rose and walked the boundaries of its domain, weaving magic into a shield that the corruption could not easily penetrate. But defense alone would not suffice-the darkness had to be confronted at its source, driven back before it could take root too deeply to be removed.</p>
<p>For it is written: a fire that is merely contained will burn until its fuel is exhausted, but a fire that is quenched at its heart will trouble the world no more.</p>
<p>The Wild Spirit sent its call across Aedelore, a summons that spoke not to ears but to hearts. Seven heard and answered, drawn from the diverse peoples of the realm by a purpose they felt before they understood.</p>
<p>Thalnuk of the Dwarves came bearing a warhammer etched with runes of protection, his heart forged in the same fires that had shaped his ancestors. Lyrielle of the Elves brought mastery of the arcane arts and a spirit that resonated with the Living Weave. Kaldor of the Humans carried a sword and a courage that could inspire the fearful to stand firm.</p>
<p>Eryndor the rogue emerged from shadows to serve the light, his daggers quick and his wit quicker. Morrigan the huntress came with her bow of heartwood and her bond to the wild creatures. Vesper the seer brought visions of what might be and wisdom to interpret them.</p>
<p>And Bromar came last-the outcast, the wanderer, the one whom society had rejected but whom the wild had embraced. In him the Guardian saw something the others lacked: the knowledge of what it means to be alone, and therefore the deepest understanding of what it means to belong.</p>
<p>The Battle at the Heart</p>
<p>Together, the eight advanced into the corrupted lands where the Void&#x27;&#x27;s influence had taken hold. The air itself felt wrong there, thick with a wrongness that pressed against the spirit. Trees stood twisted and dark, their leaves black as char though no fire had touched them. The ground squelched with moisture that was not water but something fouler.</p>
<p>Know then that corruption does not merely destroy-it transforms. What it touches becomes a mockery of what it was, beauty twisted into horror, life perverted into a parody of itself.</p>
<p>From this corruption emerged the Void&#x27;&#x27;s servants-creatures that had once been natural but were now something else entirely, their forms warped by the darkness that had claimed them. They came in waves, driven by a hunger that was not their own, and the champions met them with steel and spell and the fierce determination of those who fight for something greater than themselves.</p>
<p>Thalnuk&#x27;&#x27;s hammer shattered the twisted forms; Lyrielle&#x27;&#x27;s magic burned away the darkness that animated them; Kaldor&#x27;&#x27;s voice rallied the others when weariness threatened to overwhelm. Eryndor struck from unexpected angles; Morrigan&#x27;&#x27;s arrows found their marks with uncanny precision; Vesper called warnings that saved lives and turned the tide of skirmishes.</p>
<p>And Bromar-Bromar fought with a ferocity that surprised even himself, for he had finally found something worth fighting for: a place where he belonged, companions who accepted him, a purpose that gave meaning to his wandering years.</p>
<p>The Confrontation with Shadow</p>
<p>At the heart of the corruption stood its source-a manifestation of the Void given form, a towering figure of shadow that radiated despair. It was not Zelgor himself, but an echo of his power, a fragment of the primordial darkness seeking to extend its master&#x27;&#x27;s reach into the world of light.</p>
<p>The Groove Guardian stepped forward to meet it, the Wild Spirit facing the Void&#x27;&#x27;s servant as it had been created to do. Light erupted from the Guardian&#x27;&#x27;s form-not the harsh light of fire, but the gentle radiance of growing things, of sunlight filtering through leaves, of moonlight blessing the forest floor.</p>
<p>For it is written: the light of nature is not a weapon but a truth, and before truth, shadow cannot long endure.</p>
<p>The battle that followed was brief but absolute. The Guardian channeled the essence of life itself, drawing upon the strength of every root and branch, every beast and bird, every drop of water and grain of earth within its domain. The champions added their own strength to this torrent, their courage and unity amplifying the power that flowed through the Wild Spirit.</p>
<p>The shadow screamed-a sound that was felt more than heard-and began to unravel. The corruption retreated, the twisted forms collapsed, and the darkness fled back to the void from which it had come.</p>
<p>The Bond Eternal</p>
<p>When the light faded and the forest began its slow healing, the eight stood together in the heart of the grove. They were exhausted beyond words, wounded in body and spirit, but they were also transformed. They had faced the darkness together and emerged victorious, and such experiences forge bonds that do not break.</p>
<p>The Guardian regarded each of them with eyes that held the wisdom of ages. In its gaze, they saw recognition-not merely of what they had done, but of what they had become. They were no longer merely individuals of different peoples; they were a fellowship, united by purpose and proven by trial.</p>
<p>Bromar wept openly, and none thought less of him for it. For the first time in his long wandering, he had found a home-not a place, but a belonging. The others gathered around him, and in that moment, the boundaries between races and histories dissolved into something greater.</p>
<p>Thus was the fellowship formed that would answer whenever the Wild Spirit called. They scattered to their various paths, but they remained connected by invisible threads that distance could not sever. And the Verdant Heart remembered them, as it remembers all who defend the balance of the living world.</p>
<p>For it is written in the oldest groves: those who fight for nature become part of nature, and nature does not forget its own.</p>

<h3>The Grand battle of the Dragon Gods</h3>
<p>This is the most sacred of all accounts, for it speaks of the battle that made existence possible. Before there was light, there was the struggle for light. Before there was life, there was the war that won the right to life. Let those who bask in the warmth of creation remember that this warmth was purchased with divine sacrifice, and that the darkness which was driven back has never ceased its patient waiting.</p>
<p>- Preserved in the Celestial Archives by the combined priesthoods of the Six, recited unchanged since the first temples rose from the willing earth</p>
<p>Before the shaping of Aedelore, before the kindling of the first star, before time itself began its counting, there existed only potential-vast, formless, and divided against itself. In this primordial chaos, two forces stirred that would determine the fate of all that would ever be.</p>
<p>Taninsam arose from the heart of creation itself, bearing within his essence the fire that would kindle suns and the warmth that would nurture life across countless worlds. He was purpose given form, the divine will to create and sustain and illuminate the darkness.</p>
<p>But from the depths of the void came Zelgor, the Harbinger of Shadows, born from the emptiness between possibilities. He was entropy incarnate, the hunger that seeks to consume all light and return existence to the nothingness from which it emerged. His was the voice that whispered to every flame that it would one day gutter out, to every star that it would one day grow cold.</p>
<p>Know then that light and darkness are not merely opposites-they are eternal adversaries, locked in a struggle that began before time and will continue until the last moment of the last age.</p>
<p>The Gathering of the Divine</p>
<p>Taninsam understood that he could not face the void alone. Creation is not the work of a single will but of many wills united, and so he sent forth his call across the forming cosmos, summoning those who shared his purpose.</p>
<p>They came from the corners of existence, each bearing the essence of their domain: Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver with her waters of tranquility, Leviathan with his winds of change, Tiamat with her strength of enduring earth, Tatsu with his mastery of the soul&#x27;&#x27;s essence, and Tohu with her weaving of magic itself.</p>
<p>Together they formed a council of divine purpose, and together they turned their gaze toward the advancing shadow.</p>
<p>For it is written: unity is the first principle of creation, as division is the first principle of destruction. What stands together cannot easily fall; what stands alone falls eventually.</p>
<p>The Confrontation at the Edge of Being</p>
<p>Zelgor awaited them at the boundary between existence and void, his form a writhing mass of shadow that seemed to consume light merely by existing. When he spoke, his voice carried the chill of entropy itself:</p>
<p>&quot;You who would create-do you not understand? All that is made will one day be unmade. All that is lit will one day be dark. I am not your enemy; I am your inevitability. Surrender now to what must eventually come, and spare yourselves the suffering of hope.&quot;</p>
<p>But Taninsam answered with words that would echo through all subsequent ages:</p>
<p>&quot;What must eventually come need not come today. And in the time between now and eventually, there will be light, and life, and love, and all the wonders that your void has never known. We do not deny that darkness awaits at the end-but we deny that the end is all that matters. The journey matters. The light matters. And for the sake of that light, we will fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus did the Grand Battle begin.</p>
<p>The War of Elements</p>
<p>Taninsam unleashed his flames-not merely fire, but the essence of creation itself, the primal force that kindles stars and warms the hearts of all living things. The void recoiled before this assault, shadows burning away like morning mist before the rising sun.</p>
<p>Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver brought forth her waters, and where they flowed, they carried cleansing and renewal, washing away the corruption that Zelgor tried to spread. Leviathan stirred the winds into tempests that scattered the gathering darkness, refusing to let shadow find purchase. Tiamat raised barriers of cosmic matter, shields against which the void&#x27;&#x27;s assaults broke like waves against a cliff.</p>
<p>Tatsu wove the potential of souls not yet born into the fabric of the battle, lending strength from futures that Zelgor would unmake if he prevailed. And Tohu danced among her siblings, her magic amplifying their powers, binding their separate strengths into a unified whole that was greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Yet Zelgor was not easily overcome. He was the void, and the void is patient. His shadows absorbed what they could not deflect; his darkness adapted to each new assault. For every tendril that was burned away, another emerged from the infinite emptiness behind him.</p>
<p>Know then that the battle was not won in a moment of triumph but through an eternity of struggle. Neither side could achieve decisive victory, for light cannot exist without shadow to define it, and shadow cannot exist without light to flee from.</p>
<p>The Driving Back of Darkness</p>
<p>In the end, what decided the battle was not power but purpose. Zelgor fought to destroy; the Dragon Gods fought to create. And creation, though it may seem the weaker force, carries within it something that destruction can never match: meaning.</p>
<p>With a final, unified effort that shook the foundations of existence, the six Dragon Gods drove Zelgor back into the deepest void. They could not destroy him-for how can one destroy the concept of ending itself?-but they could banish him, seal him away, buy time for creation to take root and flourish.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not over,&quot; Zelgor whispered as the void closed around him. &quot;I am patient. I will wait. And one day, when your light has grown weary and your unity has fractured, I will return.&quot;</p>
<p>And Taninsam answered: &quot;Then we will be waiting. And we will fight you again. And we will continue fighting until the last star burns out and the last soul fades. For that is what it means to stand for the light.&quot;</p>
<p>The Legacy of the Battle</p>
<p>The Grand Battle left scars upon the cosmos that can never fully heal. The energy released became the raw material from which Aedelore would be shaped. The Dragon Gods, exhausted but triumphant, turned their attention to the work of creation, knowing that their victory had purchased not peace but time.</p>
<p>For it is written in the oldest teachings: the war between light and shadow has no end, only pauses. Each generation must fight its own battle, must make its own stand, must choose whether to carry the flame forward or let it gutter into darkness.</p>
<p>The Dragon Gods knew this. They created Aedelore not as a paradise immune to shadow, but as a bastion in the eternal war-a place where light could flourish, where life could thrive, and where mortal souls could learn the truth that the gods had discovered in their battle against the void:</p>
<p>That light is worth fighting for. That hope is not foolishness but courage. And that even when darkness seems inevitable, the choice to stand against it is never wasted.</p>
<p>Thus did the Grand Battle end, and thus did creation begin. And in the spaces between stars, in the darkness beyond the edge of light, Zelgor waits still-patient as entropy, eternal as the void, certain that his time will come again.</p>
<p>But so too do those who remember the battle. And so too does the flame of Taninsam burn, undimmed through all the ages, a promise that the light will never surrender.</p>

<h3>The Founding of Ambers Call</h3>
<p>This chronicle speaks of glory and loss, of triumph and tragedy intertwined as they always are in the tales of mortal peoples. The Dwarves carved Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call from living stone and filled it with wonders-and then they watched it fall to darkness. Let those who read these words understand that what is built can be lost, but what is remembered can be reclaimed.</p>
<p>- Inscribed in the exile halls by Kaela Stonebreaker, daughter of Thrain, so that future generations might know both the heights their ancestors reached and the depths to which they fell</p>
<p>In the age when the Dwarves first ventured beyond their ancestral mountains, there arose among them one whose vision reached further than most: Thrain Stonebreaker, whose name would become synonymous with both the greatest achievement and the greatest loss of his people in those early days.</p>
<p>Know then that the Dwarves are children of the earth, born from Tiamat&#x27;&#x27;s blessing and Tohu&#x27;&#x27;s magic in the heart of Mount Basin. The stone speaks to them in ways it speaks to no other people, and the call of undiscovered depths is to a Dwarf what the call of the horizon is to a sailor. They must answer, or they are not truly what they were made to be.</p>
<p>Thrain heard a call louder than most-a summons from the east, where mountains none of his people had ever seen held riches none had ever imagined. He gathered those who shared his vision, and together they journeyed into the unknown.</p>
<p>The Discovery of the Amber Spire</p>
<p>For seasons beyond counting, they crossed hostile lands, enduring hardships that would have broken lesser peoples. But Dwarves are as patient as the stone they shape, and as enduring as the mountains they call home. Where others would have turned back, they pressed forward, trusting in the call that led them on.</p>
<p>At last they came to a valley nestled between two ranges of mountains that seemed to touch the sky itself. And there, in the heart of that valley, they beheld a wonder that stole the breath from their lungs and the words from their tongues.</p>
<p>A spire of pure amber rose from the earth, glowing with inner light as though a piece of the sun had been buried there since the shaping of the world. Beneath it, the ground thrummed with power, and the stone itself seemed to sing a welcome.</p>
<p>Thrain fell to his knees before that spire, and he understood: this was not merely a place to build a city. This was a place that had been waiting for them, a gift from the earth to its children, a promise that what they built here would endure through ages.</p>
<p>For it is written: the earth knows its own, and prepares for them places of power and purpose.</p>
<p>The Rising of Glory</p>
<p>The Dwarves built Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call as they had never built before-not merely with skill, but with love. Every hall was a testament to their gratitude; every tunnel was a prayer of thanksgiving. The city grew vast and beautiful, its chambers lined with the amber that had called them there, its forges burning with fires that never cooled.</p>
<p>From this stronghold, they expanded across Eastwatch, founding settlements and fortresses wherever the stone called them. They grew wealthy beyond measure, and powerful beyond any threat they could imagine. Merchants came from distant lands to trade for their crafts; scholars came to study their techniques; even the Elves, in their ageless wisdom, spoke of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call with admiration.</p>
<p>And for a time, it seemed that nothing could threaten what they had built.</p>
<p>Know then that prosperity is a blessing, but it is also a test. Those who pass through hardship together may falter when hardship seems behind them. Vigilance maintained in times of danger is often abandoned in times of peace.</p>
<p>The Coming of Shadows</p>
<p>The first warnings came as whispers-tales from distant scouts of Orcs and Trolls gathering in numbers not seen since the great wars of old. But the Dwarves had defeated such threats before, and confidence had become complacency. They heard the warnings, but they did not heed them.</p>
<p>What they did not understand-what they could not have known-was that these were not ordinary enemies. The Void had touched them, corrupting their flesh and their minds, granting them power beyond their natural measure. Dark magic flowed through their ranks, and a terrible purpose united them: to take Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call and everything within it.</p>
<p>The assault came on a night when the moon hid its face, as though it could not bear to witness what was to come. The Void-touched horde descended upon the city with fury beyond reason, their numbers blotting out the stars, their battle-cries drowning out all other sound.</p>
<p>The Dwarves fought as they had always fought-with courage and skill and the strength of their ancestors. But they had grown soft in their prosperity, and their enemies had grown strong in their corruption. The walls that had seemed impregnable were breached; the gates that had seemed eternal were shattered.</p>
<p>The Fall and the Oath</p>
<p>Thrain, old now but still bearing his ancient hammer, made his final stand in the Hall of Amber, before the spire that had first called his people to this place. Around him gathered those who would not flee, those who chose to die in the heart of their home rather than live in exile.</p>
<p>The Void-touched broke upon them like waves upon a cliff, but even cliffs crumble eventually. One by one, the defenders fell, until only Thrain remained, his hammer singing its death-song, his voice raised in the old war-chants of his people.</p>
<p>When he fell at last, struck down by a creature that had once been a Troll but was now something far worse, the light of the amber spire flickered and dimmed. The heart of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call had been corrupted, and with it, the dream of generations.</p>
<p>But not all were lost. Through secret tunnels known only to the royal line, Thrain&#x27;&#x27;s daughter Kaela led a remnant to safety. They emerged into the cold dawn, refugees from the only home they had ever known, bearing nothing but their lives and the memory of what they had lost.</p>
<p>And there, in the light of a sun that seemed to mock their grief, Kaela Stonebreaker made an oath that would echo through all subsequent generations:</p>
<p>&quot;By my father&#x27;&#x27;s broken hammer, by the blood of those who fell, by the stone that remembers-I swear that Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call will rise again. The darkness that has claimed it will be driven out, and our people will return. This I vow, and may the earth itself witness my words.&quot;</p>
<p>The Endurance of Memory</p>
<p>The Dwarves of Eastwatch scattered to their lesser holdings, broken but not destroyed. They built new homes in Ironhearth and Stonegate and Greycliff, and they survived as they had always survived-by enduring what could not be avoided and working toward what seemed impossible.</p>
<p>The fall of Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call became more than history; it became a lesson, a warning, a sacred teaching passed from parent to child. Never again would they grow complacent. Never again would they assume that what was built would stand forever. Never again would they stop watching the darkness for signs of its return.</p>
<p>And in every Dwarven hall, no matter how humble, the oath of Kaela Stonebreaker is remembered. The forges still burn; the hammers still ring; the people still endure. And they wait, patient as the stone from which they came, for the day when they will return to Amber&#x27;&#x27;s Call and reclaim what the darkness stole.</p>
<p>For it is written in the deepest places: what is lost can be found, what has fallen can rise, and the earth never forgets its children.</p>

<h3>Birth of Humans</h3>
<p>This is the account of our becoming, for we who call ourselves Human were not always what we are now. We emerged from transformation, shaped by a world where magic had been withdrawn, and in that shaping we found our purpose. Let those who think us lesser for our brief lives understand: we burn brightly because we know how little time we have, and in that brightness lies a power all our own.</p>
<p>- From the Chronicles of the Second Children, maintained by the Archivists of Lutovia since the city&#x27;&#x27;s founding</p>
<p>In the age following the First War, when the wounds of conflict still bled across the land and the grief of the gods hung heavy over all creation, a change came upon Aedelore that would reshape its peoples forever. Tohu, the Dragon Goddess of Magic, had witnessed the devastation wrought by those she had trusted with power, and in her sorrow, she withdrew her gift.</p>
<p>Know then that magic is not merely a tool-it is a relationship between the wielder and the Living Weave that underlies all existence. When Tohu pulled back the Weave, she did not merely limit what could be done; she changed the very nature of those who had depended upon it.</p>
<p>The Elves felt this change most keenly, for their lives had been woven into the magic of the world since their arrival from doomed Elarion. They had drawn strength from the Weave with every breath, renewed themselves through its power, existed in a state of communion with the mystical forces that flowed through all things.</p>
<p>When that communion was weakened, some among them began to change.</p>
<p>The Transformation</p>
<p>It did not happen in a single generation, nor even in ten. It was a gradual dimming, like the slow fading of a lamp whose oil runs low. Certain bloodlines, certain individuals, found that the magic they had once wielded effortlessly now slipped through their grasp like water through fingers.</p>
<p>Their lives shortened. Their features softened. Their connection to the Weave became a distant echo rather than a constant presence. They were still themselves-still possessed of memory and purpose and will-but they were becoming something else as well.</p>
<p>The Elves who remained unchanged looked upon their transforming kin with sorrow and confusion. Some called them diminished; some called them cursed; some whispered that they had been abandoned by the gods themselves. For what else could explain this fading of the immortal spark?</p>
<p>But the changing ones did not see themselves as diminished. They could not, for they were too busy adapting, too busy surviving, too busy discovering what they could become when they could no longer be what they had been.</p>
<p>For it is written: every ending is also a beginning, and what seems like loss may be transformation in disguise.</p>
<p>The Gift of Brevity</p>
<p>The first generations of the changed ones-those who would come to call themselves Human-struggled to find their place in a world that no longer seemed designed for them. They watched their Elven kin live on decade after decade while they aged and died in what seemed, to immortal eyes, the blink of a moment.</p>
<p>Yet in this brevity they discovered something unexpected: urgency.</p>
<p>Where the Elves could afford to contemplate a decision for a century, Humans had to act now. Where the Elves could master a single craft across a thousand years, Humans had to learn quickly or not at all. Where the Elves could wait for problems to resolve themselves, Humans had to solve them immediately or perish.</p>
<p>This urgency became their strength. They built faster than any people before them. They explored further, risked more, adapted more quickly to changing circumstances. They formed alliances not because they had centuries to build trust, but because they recognized that cooperation today was the only way to survive until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Know then that limitations are not merely constraints-they are also catalysts. What we cannot do shapes what we must do, and what we must do often becomes what we do best.</p>
<p>The Cities of Unity</p>
<p>In time, the Humans earned a place among the peoples of Aedelore not through magic or immortality, but through the very qualities that had emerged from their transformation. Their resourcefulness impressed the Dwarves; their adaptability earned the respect of even the proudest Elves; their energy and ambition created possibilities that neither of the elder races had imagined.</p>
<p>The founding of East Trade marked the first great collaboration between the three peoples-a city built where their territories met, where their strengths could combine. Here Elven wisdom guided, Dwarven craftsmanship built, and Human ambition drove the work forward at a pace that amazed all who witnessed it.</p>
<p>More cities followed. Lutovia rose in the heart of the land, becoming a symbol of Human civilization and a gathering place for all the free peoples. Castle Black was raised in the northeast, a fortress built by Human and Elven hands together, standing guard against the darkness that lingered in the world.</p>
<p>For it is written: what one people cannot achieve alone, many peoples may accomplish together, and the bonds forged in shared labor are stronger than chains of steel.</p>
<p>The Second Children</p>
<p>The Elves came to call them the Second Children-not as an insult, but as an acknowledgment of a truth. The Humans had emerged from the Elves as children emerge from parents, different but related, carrying forward something of what had come before while becoming something entirely new.</p>
<p>And the Humans embraced this identity, for they understood what it meant. They were not Elves who had failed to remain Elves; they were something else entirely, a people shaped by transformation and defined by their response to it. Their brief lives were not a curse but a gift-a fire that burns hot precisely because it cannot burn forever.</p>
<p>In every Human achievement, there is this urgency: the knowledge that time is short and therefore precious, that every day matters because there are so few of them, that legacy must be built quickly if it is to be built at all.</p>
<p>Thus did Humanity find its purpose in Aedelore-not as a diminished echo of what had been, but as a new voice in the chorus of creation. Their elders may live longer and remember more, but Humans dream bigger and reach further, for they know that hesitation is a luxury they cannot afford.</p>
<p>For it is written in the chronicles of all peoples: the Second Children burn with a light all their own, and in that light, the world has been changed in ways that even the immortal could not have foreseen.</p>

<h3>Birth of Dwarves</h3>
<p>This is the oldest of our songs, sung in the deep halls when the forges burn low and the elders gather to speak of the beginning. We emerged from the living stone, shaped by divine hands, and the stone remembers us as we remember it. Let those who hear these words understand: we are not merely dwellers in the mountains-we are children of the mountains, and the earth is our mother.</p>
<p>- Preserved in the Chant of Origins by the Stone Speakers of Mount Basin, sung unchanged since the first voices learned to sing</p>
<p>In the early ages of Aedelore, when the world was still new and the work of the Dragon Gods was fresh upon the land, there came a time of contemplation. The great shapers looked upon what they had created and saw that it was beautiful-but beauty without witnesses is merely potential, and potential unfulfilled is purpose denied.</p>
<p>The land was ready for peoples to walk upon it. The waters were ready to quench their thirst. The forests were ready to shelter them, and the mountains were ready to be their homes. What was needed now was the peoples themselves.</p>
<p>Know then that creation is not a single act but a continuing process. The Dragon Gods did not merely make the world and abandon it; they shaped it and then filled it, guided it and then released it, gave it not just form but the capacity to grow beyond what they had imagined.</p>
<p>And in the heart of Mount Basin, the greatest of all peaks, two of the divine turned their attention to a new work.</p>
<p>The Shaping in Stone</p>
<p>Tiamat, She Who Endures, looked upon the mountain she had raised and saw within it the potential for a new people. The stone was strong, patient, enduring-and these qualities, she knew, could be given form and consciousness, could be breathed into beings who would carry them forward through all the ages to come.</p>
<p>She spoke to Tohu, the Weaver of Magic, and together they conceived a creation unlike any that had come before. Not beings born of flesh and blood, but beings born of stone and spirit-children of the earth itself, carrying within them the essence of the mountains that would be their home.</p>
<p>Tiamat breathed her strength into the deep rock of Mount Basin, imbuing it with the potential for life. And Tohu wove her magic through the mineral veins, giving form to what Tiamat had blessed, shaping consciousness from crystal and will from ore.</p>
<p>For it is written: life does not require flesh alone. Life is spirit shaped by purpose, and purpose can dwell in stone as surely as in any softer vessel.</p>
<p>The Emergence</p>
<p>The first Dwarves opened their eyes in darkness-the warm darkness of the earth&#x27;&#x27;s embrace, the comforting shadow of stone that had been their womb. They felt the mountain around them not as a weight but as a presence, a mother whose heartbeat was the slow pulse of geological time.</p>
<p>When they emerged into the light for the first time, they did not forget what they had left behind. The stone called to them always, and they answered that call with every hall they carved, every tunnel they dug, every treasure they drew from the depths. They were not merely miners and craftsmen; they were translators, giving voice to the earth&#x27;&#x27;s silent beauty.</p>
<p>Know then that the Dwarves do not conquer mountains-they converse with them. Each stroke of the pick is a question; each vein of ore uncovered is an answer. The great halls of the Dwarven kingdoms are not impositions upon the stone but revelations of what the stone always contained.</p>
<p>The First Meeting</p>
<p>In time, the Dwarves ventured beyond their mountain home, curious about the world that spread beneath the open sky. Though the endless space above made many uncomfortable, their curiosity was stronger than their unease, and they pressed forward into lands they had never known.</p>
<p>It was in the green places where forest met mountain that they first encountered the Elves-graceful beings who moved through trees as the Dwarves moved through stone, who drew magic from the living wood as the Dwarves drew metal from the earth.</p>
<p>At first, each people regarded the other with cautious wonder. They were so different: the Elves tall and slender, the Dwarves broad and sturdy; the Elves speaking of stars and spirits, the Dwarves speaking of ore and alloy. What could such different peoples have to say to one another?</p>
<p>Yet difference, they discovered, was not division. Where the Dwarves saw the Elves&#x27;&#x27; magic as strange, they also saw its beauty. Where the Elves saw the Dwarves&#x27;&#x27; craftsmanship as mundane, they also saw its power. Each possessed what the other lacked, and in that complementarity lay the seed of friendship.</p>
<p>The Forging of Bonds</p>
<p>In meadows where the forest met the mountains, the two peoples began to meet and share. The Dwarves demonstrated the arts of metallurgy and stonecraft, revealing how beauty could be drawn from the seemingly unyielding earth. The Elves shared their knowledge of the living world, showing how magic flowed through all things and how harmony could be achieved between peoples and the land they inhabited.</p>
<p>For it is written: wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied, and the teacher often learns as much as the student.</p>
<p>Together, they built a settlement at the base of Mount Basin-a place where Dwarven forges burned beside Elven gardens, where stone structures rose among living trees. It was a symbol of what could be achieved when different peoples chose to build together rather than apart.</p>
<p>This friendship endured through ages of peace and ages of strife. When darkness threatened, Dwarf and Elf stood together; when prosperity blessed the land, they shared it equally. The bond forged in those early meetings proved stronger than any metal the Dwarves could craft, more enduring than any spell the Elves could weave.</p>
<p>The Children of Stone</p>
<p>The Dwarves spread across Aedelore in the ages that followed, building great halls beneath mountains throughout the land. They never forgot their origins in Mount Basin, and they never lost the connection to stone that Tiamat had placed within them.</p>
<p>Each Dwarf, from the mightiest king to the humblest miner, carries within them the blessing of the Earth Goddess-the patient strength that endures when all else crumbles, the deep understanding that speaks the language of stone. They are not merely a people who live in mountains; they are a people who are, in some fundamental way, of the mountains.</p>
<p>And the friendship with the Elves that began in those early days has never been broken, though it has been tested. For both peoples remember what was learned in that first meeting: that difference is not a barrier but an opportunity, and that together, they can achieve what neither could accomplish alone.</p>
<p>Thus did the Dwarves come to be, and thus did they find their place among the peoples of Aedelore. The stone remembers their emergence, and they remember the stone-an eternal bond between children and mother, between those who shape and that which is shaped.</p>
<p>For it is written in the deepest halls: we came from the mountain, and to the mountain we shall return. And in between, we build, and craft, and endure.</p>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>Arrival of the Elves</h3>
<p>This is the tale of our coming, preserved in the memory of House Lorendel since our ships first touched these shores. We fled destruction and found purpose; we escaped one doom and swore to prevent another. Let every Elf who reads these words remember: we are the watchers on the walls, and our vigilance is the price of Aedelore&#x27;&#x27;s peace.</p>
<p>- From the Scrolls of Arrival, kept in the Great Library of Lorenzia, recited at the Ceremony of Remembrance when the autumn leaves fall</p>
<p>Long before the counting of years in Aedelore, before the Dwarves had spread beyond Mount Basin or Humans had emerged from their transformation, there came across the vast and empty seas a fleet of ships bearing a desperate people. They were the Elves, and they were fleeing the death of a world.</p>
<p>Their homeland of Elarion had been consumed by a catastrophe they called the Sundering-a breaking of the very foundations of existence that swallowed cities and cracked continents and drowned in moments what had taken ages to build. The cause of this calamity was debated among their sages, but its effect was beyond debate: Elarion was no more, and those who had escaped were all that remained of a civilization that had once touched the stars.</p>
<p>Know then that the Elves did not come to Aedelore as conquerors or explorers, but as survivors. They carried with them the weight of loss, the memory of what had been destroyed, and a terrible understanding: that even the most magnificent civilization can fall, and that those who forget this truth are doomed to see it proven again.</p>
<p>The Landing in the North</p>
<p>Guided by ancient prophecies that had foretold both the Sundering and the sanctuary beyond the sea, the Elven ships made landfall in the northern reaches of Aedelore. The land that greeted them was wild and beautiful, rich with magic that resonated with their own, and for a moment they allowed themselves to hope that they had found a new home.</p>
<p>But as they explored this new land, they sensed something that chilled them to the core: the presence of darkness, dormant but not dead, lurking in the distant reaches of the world. It was a shadow they recognized-not the specific evil that had destroyed Elarion, but its kin. The void that hungers. The darkness that waits.</p>
<p>The Elves understood then that they had not escaped doom; they had merely been given a chance to face it again, on different terms, with the lessons of Elarion to guide them.</p>
<p>For it is written: those who survive catastrophe carry with them both burden and blessing-the burden of memory, and the blessing of knowing what must not be repeated.</p>
<p>The Building of Bastions</p>
<p>Under the leadership of House Lorendel, the Elves resolved to build not merely homes but fortresses, not merely cities but watchposts against the darkness they sensed gathering in the shadows of the world. Their civilization would be founded on vigilance, and their purpose would be protection.</p>
<p>First they raised Lorenzia in the south, where they could watch over the borders between the heartland and the distant places where darkness dwelt. The city rose as a fortress of shining stone, its walls woven with protective magic, its towers standing as sentinels against whatever might come from the shadowed reaches.</p>
<p>Lorenzia became the sword and shield of the Elven people-a place where warriors trained and mages studied, where the arts of war were preserved alongside the arts of peace. Its people never forgot that their beautiful city existed for a purpose beyond beauty: to stand between the light and whatever sought to extinguish it.</p>
<p>The Founding of Rivermount</p>
<p>Yet the Elves knew that swords alone could not hold back darkness. Magic was needed-not the magic of destruction, but the magic of preservation, of purification, of maintaining the balance that kept the world whole.</p>
<p>In the northwest, where rivers flowed with water that seemed to carry light within it, they built Rivermount-a city dedicated to the study and channeling of the Living Weave that Tohu had woven into Aedelore&#x27;&#x27;s fabric. Here the greatest mages of the Elven people gathered to learn the secrets of the land, to understand its flows of power, and to develop the means to keep those flows pure.</p>
<p>The rivers that ran through Rivermount were not merely water; they were conduits of magical energy, channels through which the Elves could work their protective spells. From this city, they reached out across the land, maintaining the balance of forces, purifying corruption where it arose, ensuring that the darkness they sensed in the distance could find no purchase in the realms they guarded.</p>
<p>Know then that magic is not merely power-it is responsibility. Those who wield it must use it in service of balance, or they become no different from the darkness they oppose.</p>
<p>The Twin Pillars</p>
<p>Lorenzia and Rivermount became the twin pillars of Elven civilization in Aedelore-one dedicated to the way of the warrior, the other to the way of the mage. Between them, they formed a defense both physical and mystical, a net of protection that covered the lands the Elves had claimed.</p>
<p>Communication flowed between the cities through means both mundane and magical. When Lorenzia&#x27;&#x27;s watchers spotted movement in the shadows, Rivermount&#x27;&#x27;s mages were already preparing to respond. When Rivermount&#x27;&#x27;s seers glimpsed threats in their visions, Lorenzia&#x27;&#x27;s warriors were already arming for battle.</p>
<p>And in both cities, the memory of Elarion was kept alive-not as a wound that would not heal, but as a teacher that would not be silenced. The Elves remembered what they had lost, and in that remembering found the strength to ensure that they would not lose again.</p>
<p>The Sacred Duty</p>
<p>In time, the Elves spread across Aedelore, building settlements and forming relationships with the Dwarves they encountered. But wherever they went, they carried with them the purpose that had been forged in the fires of the Sundering: to watch, to guard, to protect.</p>
<p>This was their sacred duty, sworn upon the ashes of the home they had lost. They would be the watchers on the walls, the guardians in the towers, the voices that raised the alarm when darkness stirred. They had failed to protect Elarion, but they would not fail to protect Aedelore.</p>
<p>For it is written in the oldest memories: we fled the Sundering not merely to survive, but to remember. And in remembering, we became the shield against the darkness that ever hungers, ever waits, ever seeks to consume what the light has built.</p>
<p>Thus did the Elves come to Aedelore, and thus did they take up their eternal watch. The shadow that destroyed Elarion was not the same shadow that lurks at the edges of this world, but shadow is shadow, and darkness is darkness. What was learned there applies here, and the Elves will stand ready until the last star fades from the sky.</p>

<h3>Conquest of Borea</h3>
<p>This tale is told in the frozen reaches where the wind carries memories of battles fought in ages past. It speaks of shadow against light, of ambition broken upon the walls of duty, and of the eternal vigilance that guards the sacred places of the world. Let those who dwell in warmer lands know that Borea is protected-and that the darkness which was driven back still remembers its defeat.</p>
<p>- Recorded by the Frost Wardens who maintain the ancient watch in the land of eternal winter</p>
<p>In the cold expanse of Borea, where winter holds eternal dominion and the boundary between the world of the living and the realm of spirits grows thin as ice, there came a presence that did not belong. Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen, descended from the shadowy depths of the void, her darkness a wound upon the pristine white of the frozen land.</p>
<p>Know then that Nyxora was not born of mortal desires or mortal fears. She emerged from the chaos of Zelgor&#x27;&#x27;s fury in the ages before Aedelore took its present form, shaped from shadow and spite, her being intertwined with the Harbinger of Darkness himself. What drove her was not mere ambition but something older and deeper: the desire to reclaim what her beloved had lost, to build a fortress from which shadow could one day challenge light again.</p>
<p>Borea called to her. The eternal winter, the thin veil between worlds, the ancient spirits that wandered its frozen expanse-all of these whispered possibilities to her heart. Here, she thought, she would build her bastion. Here, the shadows would take root. Here, vengeance would find its home.</p>
<p>But Borea was not unguarded, and Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s intrusion did not pass unnoticed by those who had sworn to protect the sacred places of the world.</p>
<p>The Challenge of the Guardians</p>
<p>Two of the Dragon Gods held dominion over Borea: Tatsu, the Enigmatic God of Souls, and Leviathan, the Mighty God of Air. Since the earliest ages, they had watched over this realm where the veil between life and death grew thin, ensuring that the passage of souls remained undisturbed and that the ancient spirits found peace.</p>
<p>When they sensed Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s darkness spreading across their sacred charge, they rose to meet it with the terrible patience of the divine.</p>
<p>&quot;You do not belong here, Shrouded Queen,&quot; Tatsu&#x27;&#x27;s voice echoed across the frozen plain, carrying the weight of ages and the wisdom of countless souls. &quot;Borea is a sanctuary, not a fortress. Your darkness cannot be permitted to take root in this place.&quot;</p>
<p>Nyxora rose to face them, her form writhing with barely contained power. &quot;I do not seek permission from servants of a dead order. The light that drove back Zelgor has grown weak. The watchers have grown complacent. And I have grown patient enough to reclaim what should have been ours from the beginning.&quot;</p>
<p>For it is written: the confrontation between light and shadow is eternal, and each generation must fight its own battle in the endless war.</p>
<p>The Battle in the Frozen Wastes</p>
<p>The battle that followed shook Borea to its ancient foundations. Nyxora summoned storms of shadow, weaving illusions that twisted reality itself into weapons. The frozen landscape became a canvas of chaos, darkness bleeding into ice, phantoms rising from every drift of snow.</p>
<p>But Tatsu and Leviathan were not merely gods-they were guardians, and guardians do not yield what has been entrusted to them. Tatsu&#x27;&#x27;s soul-fire pierced through Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s illusions, revealing truth beneath deception. Leviathan&#x27;&#x27;s winds scattered the shadows she gathered, denying her the darkness she needed to grow strong.</p>
<p>Again and again, Nyxora struck, and again and again, she was repelled. She called forth servants of shadow; Tatsu unraveled them with beams of soul-light. She wove labyrinths of illusion; Leviathan&#x27;&#x27;s winds tore them apart. She reached for the thin veil between worlds, hoping to draw power from the spirits that dwelt beyond; Tatsu stood at that boundary like a wall of divine will, and would not let her pass.</p>
<p>Know then that power alone cannot overcome purpose. Nyxora was mighty, but her might served only herself. The dragon gods were bound to something greater than their own desires, and in that binding lay a strength she could not match.</p>
<p>The Defeat and the Warning</p>
<p>In the final confrontation, Nyxora gathered all her darkness into a single assault-a serpent of pure void, hungry and terrible, reaching for the throat of the world. She poured into it everything she had, every shadow she had gathered, every illusion she had crafted, every dream of vengeance she had nursed through ages of waiting.</p>
<p>And Tatsu met it with the light of souls-not the cold light of destruction, but the warm radiance of purpose fulfilled, of lives well-lived, of the peace that comes to those who have walked their paths to their end. It was not an attack but a truth, and before truth, shadow cannot long endure.</p>
<p>The serpent shattered. Nyxora fell. And in the silence that followed, the Shrouded Queen lay defeated upon the ice she had hoped to claim.</p>
<p>&quot;You sought to conquer,&quot; Tatsu said, his voice carrying neither triumph nor condemnation, only the weight of ages, &quot;but you found only what all conquerors find: the limit of conquest. Return to your shadows, Nyxora. Nurse your wounds and your hatred. But know this-Borea is protected, and it will remain protected until the last star fades from the sky.&quot;</p>
<p>The Eternal Watch</p>
<p>Nyxora fled into the darkness that had birthed her, her dreams of conquest shattered but her hunger undiminished. The dragon gods knew she would return-not today, not tomorrow, but eventually. Shadow does not forget its defeats; it merely waits for circumstances to change.</p>
<p>And so the watch continues. The Frost Wardens, mortal servants of the guardians, patrol the frozen reaches of Borea, alert for any sign that the darkness might return. The sacred places remain protected, the boundary between worlds remains guarded, and the spirits that wander the eternal winter find the peace they seek.</p>
<p>For it is written in the ice and snow: vigilance is the price of sanctuary, and those who would protect must never rest. The Shrouded Queen remembers her defeat, and she waits. But so too do those who defeated her, and they are patient as the frost, enduring as the winter, eternal as the watch they keep.</p>
<p>Borea remains. The guardians remain. And the darkness, for now, is held at bay.</p>

<h3>Betrayal in the Shadows</h3>
<p>This account is kept in the deepest vaults of the Silent Hand, spoken only to those who have passed through the Veiling and emerged transformed. It tells of the night when our founder chose her own path-when betrayal became liberation, and darkness was turned to serve the light. Let those who read these words understand: the shadows are not evil in themselves. It is the purpose they serve that defines them.</p>
<p>- From the Secret Histories, shared only with the initiated</p>
<p>In an age when Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s influence still spread across the hidden places of the world, there walked one who had learned the deepest secrets of shadow and illusion. She had been born an Elf of Lutovia, a priestess of light, but the whispers from darkness had found her in her moments of doubt, and she had answered them.</p>
<p>Her name then was Loraniel. The name she took upon her transformation was Noctara, the Veiled Mistress of Shadows.</p>
<p>Know then that darkness does not always corrupt through force. Sometimes it seduces through truth-partial truths, twisted truths, truths that illuminate one path while hiding others. Nyxora spoke to Loraniel of hypocrisy in the halls of light, of secrets kept by those who preached openness, of power denied to those deemed unworthy. These were not lies. They were simply not the whole truth.</p>
<p>And Loraniel, who had always seen too clearly and questioned too deeply, heard these words and was changed by them.</p>
<p>The Years of Learning</p>
<p>Under Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s tutelage, Loraniel became Noctara-mistress of shadow, weaver of illusion, keeper of secrets that would drive lesser minds to madness. She learned to walk unseen through any hall, to hear whispers spoken leagues away, to bend perception until even she sometimes forgot what was real.</p>
<p>She founded the Silent Hand, a guild of those who worked in darkness. Her followers mastered the arts of subtlety and deception, becoming invisible hands that shaped events from the shadows. They gathered secrets, manipulated outcomes, served purposes that others never glimpsed.</p>
<p>Yet as the years became decades and the decades became centuries, something within Noctara began to stir. She had been taught that shadows existed to consume light, that darkness was the natural state and light merely an aberration to be corrected. But in her long years of walking in shadow, she had observed something that contradicted these teachings.</p>
<p>For it is written: truth cannot be taught, only discovered. And discovery comes to those who observe with their own eyes rather than seeing through the eyes of their masters.</p>
<p>The Revelation</p>
<p>What Noctara discovered was this: shadow and light were not enemies but partners, not opposites but complements. One could not exist without the other. A world of pure darkness was not a world at all-it was absence, void, nothingness. And a world of pure light was equally impossible, for light needs shadow to give it depth and meaning.</p>
<p>This understanding came slowly, through years of watching and thinking and questioning the purposes she served. Nyxora sought to extinguish all light; but without light, what would shadow be? What would Noctara herself be? Not a mistress of anything-merely another shade of nothing.</p>
<p>The Silent Hand had been founded to serve Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s purposes, but it need not remain bound to those purposes. The skills Noctara had learned-the seeing in darkness, the walking unseen, the gathering of secrets-these could serve balance rather than destruction. The shadows could be used to protect the light rather than consume it.</p>
<p>This realization was Noctara&#x27;&#x27;s betrayal, though she did not think of it as betrayal. She thought of it as awakening.</p>
<p>The Confrontation</p>
<p>Nyxora, of course, sensed the change in her most accomplished student. The Shrouded Queen summoned Noctara to the Shadowed Expanse, to that place where darkness was absolute and Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s power was supreme.</p>
<p>&quot;You have turned from my teachings,&quot; Nyxora said, her voice smooth as silk over ice. &quot;You serve purposes I did not give you. This cannot be permitted.&quot;</p>
<p>Noctara stood before the goddess who had shaped her, and she did not tremble. &quot;I have not turned from what you taught me. I have moved beyond it. The shadows you gave me power over-they do not wish to destroy light. They wish to exist alongside it. And I will serve that wish, not the hunger that denies it.&quot;</p>
<p>For it is written: the student who never surpasses the teacher has failed to learn. And the teacher who cannot accept being surpassed has failed to teach.</p>
<p>What followed was a battle of shadows against shadows, of illusions against illusions, of two masters of darkness contesting which vision of darkness would prevail. Nyxora struck with the fury of the spurned and the rage of the challenged; Noctara defended with the calm certainty of one who has found her purpose.</p>
<p>In the end, Noctara prevailed-not because she was stronger, but because her purpose was clearer. Nyxora fought to control; Noctara fought to free. And freedom, in the end, is always stronger than chains.</p>
<p>The New Path</p>
<p>Wounded but not destroyed, Nyxora retreated into deeper shadows, her hatred for her former student burning bright enough to cast its own dark light. Noctara knew that this was not the end-the Shrouded Queen would return, would seek vengeance, would never forgive the one who had rejected her teachings and defeated her in her own realm.</p>
<p>But that was a concern for another day. For now, Noctara had a new purpose to pursue.</p>
<p>The Silent Hand was reformed under her vision-no longer servants of Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s hunger, but guardians who worked from the shadows to protect the light. They gathered secrets not to destroy but to defend, manipulated events not to spread chaos but to preserve balance, walked unseen not to inspire fear but to protect the innocent from threats they would never know existed.</p>
<p>For it is written: the shadows are not evil. They simply are. And those who understand them can choose what purpose they will serve.</p>
<p>Thus did Noctara become not merely the Veiled Mistress of Shadows, but the guardian who works in darkness so that others may live in light. Her path was hidden from most, known only to those who walked it with her. But in secret places throughout Aedelore, her followers continued her work-seeing what others could not see, acting where others could not act, serving the light from the very heart of darkness.</p>
<p>And somewhere in the void, Nyxora waited and remembered. The war between master and student had entered a new phase, but it was far from over. The shadows would be contested for as long as shadows endured.</p>

<h3>A shadow to vanquish the light</h3>
<p>This is the account of the battle that scarred the world, when Taninsam the Flame-Bearer faced Zelgor the Harbinger in a confrontation that neither could truly win. It is read in the temples on the darkest night of the year, when the faithful gather to remember that light must be fought for, and that even the brightest flame casts shadows.</p>
<p>- Preserved in the Flame Eternal by the High Priests of Taninsam, unchanged since the first temple rose from the willing earth</p>
<p>In the ages when Aedelore was still young and the Dragon Gods walked openly among its wonders, there existed a forest so beautiful that even the divine paused to marvel at what they had created. The Brightwood was its name, and it glowed with inner light that seemed to rival the sun itself. Magic flowed freely through every leaf and branch, and creatures of impossible grace dwelt beneath its radiant canopy.</p>
<p>Taninsam, the Dragon God of Flame and Life, had breathed his essence into this forest, making it a living testament to the power of creation. Here, his fire did not burn but nurtured; his heat did not consume but quickened. The Brightwood was proof that flame could give life as well as take it, that the power of destruction could be turned to the service of growth.</p>
<p>Know then that what is beautiful will always attract those who wish to destroy beauty. What thrives will always draw the attention of those who hunger to consume. And what shines brightest will cast the darkest shadow when the light is blocked.</p>
<p>The Coming of the Harbinger</p>
<p>Zelgor had been driven back in the Grand Battle that preceded creation, but he had not been destroyed. In the void between worlds, in the darkness that exists where light has never reached, he had nursed his wounds and his hatred through ages beyond counting. His hunger had not diminished; his patience had only grown.</p>
<p>When he sensed the Brightwood-that beacon of life and light burning at the edge of his awareness-he knew he had found his target. Here was everything he despised: vitality, beauty, the triumph of creation over entropy. Here was something Taninsam loved, and therefore something Zelgor was compelled to destroy.</p>
<p>He did not approach openly, for the void had taught him cunning. He crept in shadow, gathered his strength in darkness, and when he finally emerged at the edge of the Brightwood, he was ready for a confrontation that would shake the world.</p>
<p>For it is written: darkness is patient in ways that light cannot be. It waits for the moment of weakness, the instant of distraction, the lapse in vigilance. And when it strikes, it strikes with all the force of its accumulated waiting.</p>
<p>The Battle Among the Trees</p>
<p>Taninsam met him at the boundary between light and shadow, where the radiance of the Brightwood touched the edge of Zelgor&#x27;&#x27;s darkness. The Dragon God of Flame blazed with righteous fury, his scales bright enough to sear the eyes of any mortal who might have witnessed the confrontation.</p>
<p>&quot;You will not have this,&quot; Taninsam declared. &quot;I have made it, I have blessed it, and I will defend it.&quot;</p>
<p>Zelgor&#x27;&#x27;s form writhed with anticipation, his voice like the whisper of stars dying in the void. &quot;All things I will have, in the end. But I will take this now, because you love it. Your pain will be seasoning for my feast.&quot;</p>
<p>The battle that followed was not merely physical-it was existential. Fire against shadow, creation against entropy, hope against despair. Taninsam hurled flames that could kindle new suns; Zelgor countered with darkness that could swallow galaxies. The forest between them became the battleground, and as they fought, it suffered.</p>
<p>Trees that had stood for centuries burst into flame or withered into shadow. Creatures that had known only peace fled in terror or were consumed by forces beyond their comprehension. The magical light that had defined the Brightwood flickered and dimmed as the combatants tore through its heart.</p>
<p>The Price of Victory</p>
<p>In the final reckoning, Taninsam prevailed-but at a cost that would haunt him through all subsequent ages. To drive Zelgor back, he was forced to unleash his full power, a conflagration so intense that it consumed not only the darkness but also what remained of the Brightwood.</p>
<p>When the flames died and the shadow retreated, nothing remained of the forest but ash and scar. The magic that had flowed through its every fiber was gone; the creatures that had called it home were no more. Taninsam had saved Aedelore from Zelgor&#x27;&#x27;s corruption, but he had destroyed what he loved most in the process.</p>
<p>Know then that victory is not always triumph, and triumph is not always without cost. The warrior who defeats the enemy at the price of what he fought to protect has won and lost in the same breath.</p>
<p>Zelgor retreated into the void, wounded but not destroyed, his laughter echoing through the darkness. He had lost the battle but proven his point: even the gods could be hurt, even the brightest light could be dimmed, even the most glorious creation could be reduced to nothing. And in the ashes of the Brightwood, his influence took root in ways that would not be fully understood for ages.</p>
<p>The Eternal Lesson</p>
<p>From that day forward, Taninsam&#x27;&#x27;s fire burned differently. It still gave life and warmth, but it carried within it the memory of destruction-of what had been lost, of what could be lost again if vigilance faltered.</p>
<p>The temples of the Flame-Bearer keep sacred fires burning through every night, flames that are never permitted to die. They are symbols of vigilance, reminders that the darkness which was driven back at such cost could return at any moment. The priests who tend these flames know the truth that the Brightwood taught: light is not a given, but a gift that must be protected.</p>
<p>And in the scar where the Brightwood once stood, nothing grows to this day. The land remembers what happened there, and refuses to forget. It is a wound upon the world, a reminder that even the gods can suffer, that even the most beautiful things can be lost.</p>
<p>For it is written in the ashes of the sacred grove: the war between light and shadow has no end, only pauses. Each generation must fight its own battle, must pay its own price, must learn anew the lesson that cannot be taught but only discovered-that what we love is always vulnerable, and that loving it means being willing to fight for it, even when fighting means losing something we cannot bear to lose.</p>
<p>Thus did Taninsam learn wisdom through grief, and thus do his followers learn it still. The light endures. The flame burns on. But the shadow of the Brightwood reminds them always that enduring is not the same as invulnerable, and that the price of light is eternal vigilance against the darkness that ever hungers, ever waits, ever seeks its chance to consume.</p>

<h2>Prophecies &amp; Omens</h2>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Prophecy of the Return</h3>
<p>This prophecy was spoken by Oracle Venatris in the Temple of Taninsam, three hundred years after the founding of Lorenzia. She fell into trance unbidden, spoke these words, and remembered nothing upon waking. The priests who heard it sealed it away for generations, unsure whether it promised hope or doom.</p>
<p>- Preserved in the Flame Eternal, unsealed by decree of the High Council in the year of the Crimson Moon</p>
<p>The Prophecy of the Return</p>
<p>When the Black Sun dreams its fourth dream,
And the Sealed Gate trembles in its slumber,
When brother turns blade against brother
And the faithful forget why they pray-</p>
<p>Then shall the Harbinger stir from his exile,
Reaching through cracks that complacency carves.
The shadow will walk in mortal flesh,
Speaking with voices of those you have loved.</p>
<p>Six flames must burn as one flame,
Or the darkness will swallow them singly.
Six peoples must stand as one people,
Or divided they fall into ending.</p>
<p>Seek the child born of three bloods,
Who walks between worlds without belonging.
Seek the blade that remembers its forging,
And the song that was sung before words.</p>
<p>The choice lies not with gods but mortals-
To kindle or to extinguish,
To remember or to forget,
To stand or to surrender.</p>
<p>The Void is patient. The Void is eternal.
But even eternity can be delayed
By those who choose light over darkness,
And hope over certainty of despair.</p>
<p>Interpretations</p>
<p>Scholars have debated the meaning of the Prophecy of the Return for centuries. The most widely accepted interpretations suggest:</p>
<p>&quot;The Black Sun dreams its fourth dream&quot; - The Black Sun has birthed creation three times before this cycle. A fourth dream may indicate either renewal or final destruction.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sealed Gate&quot; - Believed to refer to the great seal beneath Thorsheim, where Zelgor was driven back during the Grand Battle.</p>
<p>&quot;The child born of three bloods&quot; - This remains the most mysterious element. Some believe it refers to a being of mixed Elven, Human, and Dwarven ancestry. Others suggest it indicates a metaphorical birth from the three sources of power: divine, arcane, and natural.</p>
<p>&quot;The blade that remembers&quot; - Possibly a reference to one of the legendary weapons lost during the Age of Silence, or a weapon not yet forged.</p>
<p>For it is written: prophecy speaks in riddles because the future is not fixed. Each word contains many possibilities, and which possibility manifests depends upon the choices of those who hear it.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Warning of the Six</h3>
<p>These words were discovered carved into the foundation stones of the first temple raised after the Grand Battle, in a language that predates all mortal tongues. The translation is imperfect, for some concepts in the divine speech have no mortal equivalent. Nevertheless, the warning is clear.</p>
<p>- Translated by the combined efforts of the Ecumenical Council, after seventeen years of study</p>
<p>The Warning of the Six</p>
<p>We who shaped this world from chaos speak now to those who will inherit it:</p>
<p>The darkness is not gone. It waits.
The seal is not permanent. It weakens.
The war is not over. It pauses.</p>
<p>We cannot fight forever.
Even divine fire eventually dims.
Even eternal vigilance eventually falters.
Even gods eventually... rest.</p>
<p>The burden passes to mortal hands-
Fragile hands, but many.
Brief lives, but lived with purpose.
Weak flames, but kindled together, a conflagration.</p>
<p>Remember what we taught you:
Fire to illuminate the darkness.
Water to cleanse the corruption.
Wind to scatter the shadows.
Earth to stand when all else falls.
Spirit to carry hope beyond death.
Magic to bind what must never be unbound.</p>
<p>When we sleep, you must wake.
When we dream, you must act.
When the darkness returns-and it will return-
You must be ready.</p>
<p>We have given you everything we can.
The rest is your choice.
Choose wisely.
Choose together.
Choose light.</p>
<p>The Weight of Divine Trust</p>
<p>Know then that this warning confirms what the faithful have long suspected: the Dragon Gods cannot maintain their vigil forever. The seals they placed, the protections they raised, the balance they established-all of these require power, and even divine power has limits.</p>
<p>This is why the temples exist. This is why the faithful gather. This is why every prayer offered, every ritual performed, every act of devotion matters. Mortal faith does not merely honor the gods-it sustains them, reinforces the barriers they maintain, delays the inevitable moment when they must rest.</p>
<p>The Warning of the Six is both comfort and burden. Comfort, because it assures us that the gods have not abandoned us. Burden, because it reveals that ultimately, the fate of Aedelore rests in mortal hands.</p>
<p>We are not merely worshippers. We are inheritors. And the inheritance we have received is the responsibility for all creation.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Prophecy of the Silent Age</h3>
<p>Before the Age of Silence began, before Tohu withdrew the gift of magic in her grief, an unnamed seer spoke these words in the great plaza of Lorenzia. The crowd who heard dismissed them as the ravings of madness-until every word came true.</p>
<p>- Recorded belatedly by witnesses who survived the First War, in the hope that future prophecies would not be so easily ignored</p>
<p>The Prophecy of the Silent Age</p>
<p>Blood calls to blood, and blade to blade,
The children of light turn to fratricide.
Where brothers fought the void together,
Now brother spills brother&#x27;&#x27;s blood upon the earth.</p>
<p>The Weaver watches. The Weaver weeps.
Her threads are stained with crimson grief.
And in her sorrow, she will gather
The gift she gave, the light you squandered.</p>
<p>Magic will fade from mortal hands.
The Weave will thin to ghostly whispers.
Those who wielded power like birthright
Will find themselves as helpless as the newborn.</p>
<p>Long will be the years of silence.
Long will be the age of forgetting.
Generation after generation will rise
Never knowing what their ancestors lost.</p>
<p>But silence is not ending.
Forgetting is not erasing.
The Weave remembers, even when you do not.
And one day, one who remembers will call it back.</p>
<p>Through sacrifice freely given,
Through love that asks for nothing,
Through wisdom paid for in suffering,
The thread will be found, the Weave rewoven.</p>
<p>Until then, learn to live without magic.
Learn what you truly are beneath the power.
Perhaps in the silence, you will hear
What the thunder of spells always drowned out.</p>
<p>Fulfillment</p>
<p>This prophecy has already come to pass. The First War raged for fifty years before Taninsam and Tohu intervened at Nortaq. The punishment was exactly as foretold: Tohu withdrew magic from the world, beginning the Age of Silence that lasted until Auren Vale&#x27;&#x27;s sacrifice restored the Weave.</p>
<p>What makes this prophecy significant today is its final verses-the suggestion that the Age of Silence was not merely punishment but lesson. The mortal races learned to survive without magic. They developed technologies, forged alliances, built civilizations that depended on cooperation rather than power.</p>
<p>For it is written: perhaps the silence was necessary. Perhaps we needed to understand what we truly were-what we could achieve and what we would become-without the crutch of magical power. Perhaps the magic that returned is stronger because it was missed, wiser because it was lost.</p>
<p>Or perhaps another silence awaits, should we repeat the mistakes of our ancestors.</p>

<h3>Omens and Their Meanings</h3>
<p>Not all prophecy comes in grand pronouncements. Sometimes the future speaks through small signs-patterns in the stars, behaviors of beasts, dreams shared by strangers who have never met. This compendium records the known omens and their traditional interpretations.</p>
<p>- Maintained by the Order of Seers across all temples, updated with each generation&#x27;&#x27;s observations</p>
<p>Omens of the Sky</p>
<p>The Crimson Moon - When the moon rises red without explanation of dust or fire, it heralds a time of bloodshed. Wars begun under a Crimson Moon are said to be especially brutal and difficult to end.</p>
<p>The Double Star - When a star appears to split into two, then rejoin, it signals a choice that will determine the fate of nations. The splitting represents divergent paths; the rejoining, the moment when the choice is made and cannot be unmade.</p>
<p>The Falling Fire - Meteors are messages from the Dragon Gods. A single falling star is a blessing; a shower of them is a warning. A meteor that strikes the earth marks a place of power-or a place where something has awakened.</p>
<p>The Sunless Dawn - When the sun rises but brings no warmth, when daylight feels like twilight, the Void grows stronger. This omen has appeared three times in recorded history, each time preceding a significant incursion of void creatures.</p>
<p>Omens of the Earth</p>
<p>The Silent Forest - When all animals flee a forest simultaneously, when no birdsong breaks the silence and no creature stirs, something terrible approaches. The Groove Guardian&#x27;&#x27;s children sense danger that mortal senses cannot detect.</p>
<p>The Bleeding Stone - When rock weeps water that is red as blood, the boundary between worlds grows thin in that place. Such locations should be warded immediately and watched closely.</p>
<p>The Withering Circle - When vegetation dies in a perfect circle, void corruption has taken root. The circle will spread unless cleansed by fire consecrated to Taninsam.</p>
<p>Omens of Beasts</p>
<p>The Gathering of Crows - When crows gather in numbers beyond counting, death approaches on a scale that will require many guides to the afterlife. Tatsu&#x27;&#x27;s servants prepare for an influx of souls.</p>
<p>The White Stag - To see a white stag is to be marked for a quest. The Groove Guardian sends this omen to those he has chosen for a purpose, though that purpose may not be clear until it is fulfilled.</p>
<p>Wolves Howling at Noon - Wolves are creatures of night and shadow. When they howl in daylight, the natural order is disrupted. Something has changed the rules, and not for the better.</p>
<p>Omens of Dreams</p>
<p>The Shared Dream - When strangers dream the same dream on the same night, the gods are sending a message that concerns all people. Such dreams should be reported to the temples immediately.</p>
<p>The Dream of Falling Endlessly - This dream, common to many, takes on prophetic significance when the dreamer sees specific landmarks or faces during the fall. They are being shown where danger awaits.</p>
<p>The Dream of Speaking with the Dead - When the deceased speak in dreams with clarity and purpose, they carry messages from Tatsu&#x27;&#x27;s realm. Such messages should never be ignored-the dead see farther than the living.</p>
<p>A Warning About Interpretation</p>
<p>For it is written: omens speak, but mortals interpret, and interpretation is fallible. An omen&#x27;&#x27;s meaning may seem clear in hindsight while remaining obscure in the moment. The wise do not ignore omens, but neither do they act rashly upon them.</p>
<p>The future is not fixed. Omens reveal what may come, not what must come. Every sign is also a chance to change direction, to prepare, to choose differently than fate expects.</p>
<p>This is the hope that omens offer: not certainty, but warning. Not destiny, but choice.</p>

<h2>Sacred Texts</h2>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>Lordeans Final Address</h3>
<p>These were the final words spoken by Lordean before the assembled armies at Nortaq, moments before Taninsam and Tohu appeared to judge the warring peoples. They have been recited at the Festival of Remembrance ever since, a reminder of what one soul was willing to sacrifice for peace.</p>
<p>- Preserved by witnesses from all sides of the First War, their accounts remarkably consistent despite their enmity</p>
<p>Lordean&#x27;&#x27;s Final Address</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters of all races-for that is what we are, beneath the blood that stains our hands-I speak to you not as a commander, not as a warrior, but as one who has seen too much death and can bear no more.</p>
<p>Fifty years we have fought. Fifty years of fathers burying sons, of mothers weeping over empty cradles, of cities burned and forests poisoned and everything good and beautiful ground to ash beneath the boots of war.</p>
<p>And for what? For pride? For vengeance? For borders drawn on maps that the dead cannot read?</p>
<p>I have killed your sons. You have killed mine. We have each taken from the other things that can never be returned, inflicted wounds that will never fully heal. This is the truth of war-it makes monsters of us all, and calls the making glory.</p>
<p>But I say to you now: it ends. Here. Today. With me.</p>
<p>The gods gave us this world as a gift, and we have repaid their generosity with blood. We were meant to be guardians against the darkness, and instead we have become the darkness ourselves. We were trusted with creation, and we have chosen destruction.</p>
<p>If my death can purchase even one moment of hesitation, one instant where a blade is not swung, one heart that chooses mercy over murder-then it will have been worth more than all my years of war.</p>
<p>Remember me not as a warrior. Remember me as one who finally learned that some victories are not worth winning.</p>
<p>May the light of Taninsam guide you all to the peace I could not find in life.</p>
<p>The Aftermath</p>
<p>Moments after Lordean finished speaking, Taninsam and Tohu manifested above the battlefield. The punishment that followed-the withdrawal of magic, the beginning of the Age of Silence-was terrible, but it was also mercy. The war ended not with victory but with divine intervention, exactly as Lordean had hoped.</p>
<p>For it is written: Lordean did not die at Nortaq. He was transformed-taken by the gods as a symbol of what mortals could become if they chose sacrifice over slaughter. What became of him afterward, none can say.</p>
<p>What matters is not where Lordean went, but what he left behind: proof that even in the darkest moments, redemption is possible.</p>

<h3>The Covenant of the Crossing</h3>
<p>The Covenant of the Crossing was sworn between the Dragon Gods and the first Elves to arrive in Aedelore-a formal agreement that granted the refugees sanctuary in exchange for eternal vigilance. It remains the foundational document of Elven society and the basis for their relationship with the divine.</p>
<p>- Translated from the divine tongue by the combined efforts of three generations of scholars</p>
<p>The Covenant of the Crossing</p>
<p>Spoken by Taninsam, on behalf of the Six, to the survivors of Elarion:</p>
<p>We see you, children of a fallen world. We see the shadow in your eyes, the grief in your hearts, the desperate hope that drove you through the Void itself to reach our shores.</p>
<p>We know what pursues you. We have faced it ourselves, in battles that shook the foundations of creation. The darkness that consumed your world is the same darkness we drove back at the dawn of time-and the same darkness that waits, patient and eternal, for its chance to return.</p>
<p>You seek refuge. We offer more than refuge.</p>
<p>We offer purpose.</p>
<p>This world, Aedelore, was shaped by our hands and blessed by our power. It is precious to us beyond mortal understanding-the jewel of our creation, the home of our hope. We have protected it since its first moment, and we will protect it until its last.</p>
<p>But we cannot protect it alone.</p>
<p>You know the Void as we know it. You have felt its hunger, witnessed its corruption, survived its assault. This knowledge is both burden and gift-burden because you can never unknow it, gift because you can use it.</p>
<p>We offer you this covenant:</p>
<p>You may stay in Aedelore. You may build your cities, raise your children, pursue your arts and magics. You may live as free peoples, governed by your own laws, following your own traditions.</p>
<p>In exchange, you will watch. You will guard. You will remember.</p>
<p>When the shadow stirs, you will sound the alarm. When the corruption spreads, you will cleanse it. When the darkness threatens, you will stand between it and the world.</p>
<p>Not as servants, but as partners. Not as subjects, but as guardians. Not because we command it, but because you know-better than any other people in this world-why it matters.</p>
<p>Do you accept this covenant?</p>
<p>Response of the Elves, spoken by High Weaver Aelindel:</p>
<p>We who have lost everything accept.</p>
<p>We who have seen our world die accept.</p>
<p>We who carry the memory of Elarion accept.</p>
<p>Not because we must, but because we understand. We know what happens when the Void is underestimated, when vigilance falters, when the darkness is given time to spread.</p>
<p>We will watch. We will guard. We will remember.</p>
<p>For as long as Elven blood flows in mortal veins, for as long as the stars shine above Aedelore, for as long as memory endures-we will keep faith with this covenant.</p>
<p>By the twin suns that no longer shine, by the world we could not save, by the souls of those we left behind-we swear it.</p>
<p>The Living Covenant</p>
<p>This covenant has never been formally renewed because it has never been broken. Every Elf who reaches adulthood is taught its words, understands its meaning, accepts its burden. The watch continues, generation after generation, as promised.</p>
<p>For it is written: covenants are not merely words. They are relationships, living agreements that bind not through force but through choice. The Elves could abandon their vigil at any time-but they do not. They remember Elarion. They remember the cost of failure.</p>
<p>And so they watch, and guard, and remember, as they swore they would.</p>

<h3>The Treaty of Nortaq</h3>
<p>The Treaty of Nortaq was signed in the aftermath of divine judgment, when the surviving leaders of all races gathered to formalize the peace that Taninsam and Tohu had imposed. It established the principles of coexistence that have governed inter-racial relations ever since.</p>
<p>- Original held in the Hall of Accords, Lorenzia; copies in every major city of Aedelore</p>
<p>The Treaty of Nortaq</p>
<p>Preamble:</p>
<p>We, the leaders of the peoples of Aedelore-Elves and Dwarves, Humans who emerged from the silence, and all who call this world home-having witnessed the judgment of the divine and the terrible cost of our own folly, do hereby establish this treaty.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the war we waged was wrong. Not merely tactically or strategically wrong, but morally wrong-a betrayal of the purpose for which we were placed in this world, a squandering of the gift that the Dragon Gods bestowed upon us.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that no victory could have justified the losses we inflicted upon each other, and that no grievance, however legitimate, excused the atrocities we committed in its name.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the punishment we received-the withdrawal of magic, the Age of Silence that followed-was just, and that we deserved far worse.</p>
<p>With these acknowledgments as our foundation, we establish the following principles:</p>
<p>Article One: The Sanctity of Peace</p>
<p>No people of Aedelore shall wage war upon another except in response to direct aggression. Disputes shall be resolved through negotiation, mediation, or appeal to neutral arbiters. The first to break the peace shall be held accountable not only by the wronged party but by all signatories to this treaty.</p>
<p>Article Two: The Right of Refuge</p>
<p>Any being fleeing persecution may seek refuge among any signatory people, and such refuge shall not be denied without just cause. We who were all once refugees-the Elves from Elarion, the Dwarves from the depths, the Humans from transformation itself-shall never forget the desperation of displacement.</p>
<p>Article Three: The Duty of Mutual Defense</p>
<p>When the Void threatens any people of Aedelore, all shall respond as though threatened themselves. No race shall stand alone against the darkness. The divisions that led to war shall not prevent unity against the common enemy.</p>
<p>Article Four: The Preservation of Memory</p>
<p>The history of the First War shall be preserved in full, including the atrocities committed by all sides. Future generations shall be taught the truth of what occurred, so that they may understand why peace is sacred and why war is to be avoided at almost any cost.</p>
<p>Article Five: The Path to Redemption</p>
<p>No crime committed during the war shall be held against individuals who genuinely repent and work toward reconciliation. The gods have judged us collectively; we shall not compound that judgment with endless individual vengeance. Forgiveness is not forgetting-it is choosing to build a future rather than relitigate the past.</p>
<p>Closing:</p>
<p>We sign this treaty not because we trust each other-trust must be rebuilt over generations-but because we have learned, at terrible cost, that the alternative is worse. May our descendants look upon this document and understand: we chose peace not because it was easy, but because war proved too costly to continue.</p>
<p>May the Dragon Gods witness our commitment, and may they hold us to it.</p>

<h3>I. The Primordial Truth</h3>
<p>Herein lies the sacred history of Aedelore, transcribed from the whispers of the Eternal and the memories of stone. Let those who seek wisdom read with open hearts, for in these words are hidden the keys to understanding the Great Mystery. As it was spoken by the ancients, so it is written here: that which is above reflects that which is below, and through the sacred dance of light and shadow, all things find their purpose.
- Set down by Aelindor the Ageless, First Keeper of the Great Tree, in the time before counting
1:1 Hear now the words of the Primordial Truth, inscribed upon the fabric of existence itself, for before all things that are, there was the Void-the great emptiness that stretched beyond the boundaries of thought and form.
1:2 And within this Void dwelt the Black Sun, that eternal mystery which gathers unto itself the essence of creation through cycles beyond counting, patient as eternity itself, waiting for the moment of Becoming.
1:3 Know that the Black Sun had witnessed three births before this-three great cycles of creation and dissolution, each leaving its mark upon the cosmic memory. And in the silence between worlds, it gathered the wisdom of all that had been.
1:4 Long had it waited in the darkness between worlds, nurturing within its heart the seeds of a new creation, until at last the moment of release arrived, and the universe trembled with anticipation.
1:5 Then did the Black Sun release its gathered power in a great conflagration of divine fire, a cascade of light that pierced the primordial darkness, and from this sacred explosion were born the Dragon Aspects-vessels of the Eternal Light divided into six.
1:6 These were not mere gods as mortals would later understand them, but fundamental forces given form and consciousness, each carrying within them a portion of the Black Sun&#x27;&#x27;s infinite wisdom.
1:7 First among them emerged Taninsam, Keeper of the Sacred Flame, whose essence burned with the fury of a thousand suns. He was passion and creation, destruction and renewal-the fire that both gives life and consumes it. Upon his scales danced every hue of flame, from the gentle amber of hearth-fires to the terrible white of stars.
1:8 Then came Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver, Guardian of the Living Waters, serene and deep as the cosmic ocean. She was healing and reflection, the gentle tide that nurtures all things and the depths that hold mysteries untold. Her form shimmered like moonlight upon still waters.
1:9 Leviathan arose next, Master of the Winds and Bearer of the Breath of Life. He was freedom and change, the storm that transforms and the gentle breeze that carries seeds to new soil. His wings stirred currents in the void itself.
1:10 Tiamat followed, the Unmovable Foundation, steadfast as the eternal mountains. She was stability and strength, the bedrock upon which all things are built, the patient earth that endures while ages pass. Her form was carved from the essence of stone and root.
1:11 Tatsu emerged as the Shepherd of Souls, keeper of that divine spark which dwells within all living things. He was mystery and destiny, the bridge between what is and what was, the guardian of the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. His eyes held the light of countless souls.
1:12 And last came Tohu, Weaver of the Arcane, through whom the mysteries of magic flow into the world. She was knowledge and transformation, the hidden threads that connect all things, the whisper of power that waits to be discovered. Her form shifted like starlight through mist.
1:13 These newly-formed gods drifted through the primordial darkness, their forms crystallizing from light and shadow as they traversed the infinite void, each discovering the nature of their own being.
1:14 They danced together in the emptiness, their powers interweaving, learning the harmonies that would later become the laws of creation. And in this dance, they knew both joy and solitude.
1:15 In time, the Dragon Aspects grew in wisdom and sought meaning in the endless expanse of the multiverse. They traveled beyond the boundaries of thought, into realms of pure possibility.
1:16 Yet even amidst infinite possibilities, they found only the echo of their own solitude. For what is creation without something to create? What is divinity without those who would receive its gifts?
1:17 It was then that the longing awoke within them-the desire to give form to potential, to bring forth worlds that might harbor the miracle of life.
1:18 Then did Taninsam, mightiest among the Six, turn to his divine kindred and speak words of power long forgotten by mortal tongues-words that resonated with the memory of the Black Sun itself.
1:19 United in purpose, they summoned forth the forces of creation itself, weaving the heavens and the earths with strands of light and darkness, kindling the stars with fragments of their own divine fire, and shaping celestial bodies with their combined will.
1:20 Countless worlds sprang forth from their labor, each a jewel in the infinite darkness, each carrying within it the potential for wonder.
1:21 Among these works of wonder, one world was destined to hold the truest reflection of the Divine-a world where the essence of all six aspects would find perfect expression.
1:22 And this world they named Aedelore-the Land of the Divine Light, the crown of their creation.</p>

<h3>II. The Shaping of Worlds</h3>
<p>What follows was carved first in stone before it was written in ink, for the Dwarves remember what others forget. Know that the shaping of worlds is the shaping of purpose, and those who understand the bones of the earth understand the bones of truth. Read these words as you would read the veins of ore in deep rock - with patience, reverence, and the knowledge that what lies beneath is always greater than what lies above.</p>
<p>- Transcribed from the Stone Tablets of Khazad-Morin by Thordak Deepdelver, Keeper of the Heartforge, in the 4th Age of Silence</p>
<p>2:1 Know then that in the aftermath of the Great Creation, when the fires of genesis had cooled and the void had retreated before the advancing light, the Dragon Aspects descended upon a barren sphere - a vessel awaiting the breath of life.</p>
<p>2:2 They beheld its emptiness and saw not absence but potential. For what is emptiness but the canvas upon which creation paints? What is silence but the space into which music may flow?</p>
<p>2:3 They named it Aedelore - the Land of the Divine Light - and each resolved to leave their mark upon its forming. Yet know that their marks were not signatures of ownership, but gifts freely given.</p>
<p>2:4 Taninsam was first to act, for his nature knew no patience. With a breath of sacred fire, he swept across the frozen surface, and the ice surrendered to flame, melting into the depths and forming a blazing heart at the world&#x27;s core.</p>
<p>2:5 Know that this core was not merely heat, but life itself in its most primal form - the pulse that would warm Aedelore through all ages to come. From its beating would rise mountains; through its power would the earth itself breathe.</p>
<p>2:6 Tanin&#x27;iver, in her gentle wisdom, fashioned the Well of Morningstar - a font of living waters that began to pulse with the rhythm of creation. From this sacred source, all waters would flow.</p>
<p>2:7 Know that water remembers. Every river carries the memory of the Well; every raindrop holds a fragment of the first blessing. To drink of Aedelore&#x27;s waters is to taste the Divine.</p>
<p>2:8 Tiamat shaped the bones of the world with patience that mortals cannot comprehend - raising peaks that touched the heavens, carving valleys deep and true, establishing foundations that would endure until time itself grew weary.</p>
<p>2:9 She formed Mount Basin, greatest of all peaks, and within its heart she placed chambers of crystal and silence. Know that what sleeps in mountains sleeps long, and what wakes in mountains wakes with terrible purpose.</p>
<p>2:10 Tohu wove invisible threads of arcane power into the fabric of existence itself. She placed within the stones the memory of magic, within the waters the whisper of enchantment, within the wind the song of spells yet unspoken.</p>
<p>2:11 Know that magic is not a force to be commanded but a language to be learned. Tohu did not give power to Aedelore; she gave it the capacity to speak to those who would listen.</p>
<p>2:12 Tatsu breathed the essence of consciousness into the world - that ineffable spark which separates the living from the merely existing. He gave Aedelore its soul.</p>
<p>2:13 Know that this spark dwells in all things that live, from the mightiest dragon to the smallest seed. It is the thread that connects all life, the common inheritance of every creature that draws breath.</p>
<p>2:14 Leviathan stirred the atmosphere into motion, bringing winds that would carry rain to distant lands, breezes that would scatter seeds across continents, storms that would reshape the world when change was needed.</p>
<p>2:15 For countless eons, Aedelore flourished beneath the watchful gaze of its creators. Yet know that even gods grow restless, and creation calls to creation.</p>
<p>2:16 Four of the Aspects prepared to depart - Tanin&#x27;iver, Leviathan, Tiamat, and Tatsu - each carrying seeds of new creation to plant among distant stars. For the Divine does not rest; it multiplies.</p>
<p>2:17 Yet Taninsam and Tohu could not bear to abandon their most beloved work. In Aedelore they saw the fullest expression of their nature, and to leave it was to leave themselves.</p>
<p>2:18 Know that this choice was neither weakness nor attachment, but love in its purest form - the love of creator for creation, which binds more surely than any chain.</p>
<p>2:19 To remain connected to the source of all power, they planted the Great Tree of Morningstar - a living bridge between Aedelore and the infinite energy of the Black Sun.</p>
<p>2:20 Know that the Tree is not merely wood and leaf. It is a conduit, a doorway, a possibility made manifest. In its shade, magic flows freely; in its presence, the veil between worlds grows thin.</p>
<p>2:21 Thus did the two gods enter their first long slumber, hidden north of the Great Tree in the secret realm of Thorsheim - a place beyond the knowing of mortal creatures.</p>
<p>2:22 Know that the sleeping of gods is not the sleeping of mortals. They dreamed the world into continuing existence, their consciousness woven into every root and stone. They watched even as they slept, and waited for the hour when they would be needed once more.</p>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>III. The Coming of the Firstborn</h3>
<p>We who crossed the void carry within us the memory of Elarion&#x27;s light - and of its shattering. Know that our coming to Aedelore was not chance but necessity, not exploration but exile. For the Divine does not waste its children; it scatters them as seeds, that they might take root in new soil and grow toward truths their homeland could not teach.</p>
<p>- From the Archives of Lorenzia, set down by Seraphiel Dawnweaver, who remembered what others chose to forget</p>
<p>3:1 An aeon passed in the dreaming of the gods, and Aedelore lay complete yet empty - a vessel awaiting that which would fill it. For what is perfection without witness? What is a song without ears to receive it?</p>
<p>3:2 Know that in distant realms beyond the veil of stars, the High Elves had risen to mastery over the arcane. They had touched the fabric of existence itself and believed themselves its weavers.</p>
<p>3:3 Yet hear this truth: those who grasp at the source of power without understanding its nature invite their own unmaking. Elarion fell not to enemies, but to the pride of its children.</p>
<p>3:4 The Sundering tore their world asunder, and in that tearing was hidden a teaching: that power claimed is power lost, but power received in humility becomes wisdom.</p>
<p>3:5 Across the void they fled, no longer masters but refugees, no longer proud but broken. And it was in this brokenness that they became capable of receiving what Aedelore had to offer.</p>
<p>3:6 They followed the Divine Light as the lost follow any beacon, not knowing whether it led to salvation or destruction. Know that this is the nature of faith - to move toward the light even when its source is hidden.</p>
<p>3:7 When they touched Aedelore&#x27;s shores, they recognized what their pride had blinded them to in Elarion: that magic is not a tool to be wielded, but a gift to be honored. Here, the gift flowed freely to those who did not grasp.</p>
<p>3:8 They named the land Aedelore - the Divine Light - and in that naming they confessed what they had denied in their fallen home: that the light was never theirs to own.</p>
<p>3:9 Tohu watched from her dreaming and was pleased. For she had woven magic into the world not for the powerful, but for the humble. In the Elves&#x27; brokenness, she saw vessels worthy of filling.</p>
<p>3:10 Know now the mystery of the Dwarves: they did not come from beyond, but arose from within. Where the Elves were wanderers seeking home, the Dwarves were home becoming aware of itself.</p>
<p>3:11 From the stone of Mount Basin, where Tiamat&#x27;s essence still lingered like warmth in cooling embers, they emerged - not created but crystallized, as gems form in the darkness of the deep.</p>
<p>3:12 They could not wield magic as the Elves did, for they were not separate from it. The stone spoke to them because they were stone given consciousness. The metal yielded to them because they were its kin.</p>
<p>3:13 When Elf and Dwarf first met, it was the meeting of sky and earth, of wandering and rootedness, of that which seeks and that which is sought. In their difference lay the possibility of completeness.</p>
<p>3:14 Know that the Divine expresses itself through opposition as much as through unity. Light requires shadow to be seen; sound requires silence to be heard. The Elves and Dwarves were two hands of a single purpose.</p>
<p>3:15 Yet not all that emerged in Aedelore carried the refined light of the Six. In the outer regions, where magic pooled wild and untempered, the Orcs and Trolls took form - beings shaped by chaos rather than design.</p>
<p>3:16 Hear this truth and hold it close: they were not mistakes. The Divine Light, passing through the prism of existence, separates into many colors - some bright, some dark, all necessary.</p>
<p>3:17 The Orcs honored the Spirit of the Clan, carrying ancestor-bones as the Elves carried starlight. The Trolls followed the Forgotten Loa, spirits older than naming. Different paths, yet paths nonetheless.</p>
<p>3:18 For a time, all dwelt in a harmony that reflected the Divine Order - each race a note in a chord, each fulfilling its part in the great pattern. This was the Age of Magic, when the veil was thin and wonders walked openly.</p>
<p>3:19 Yet know that harmony among those who have not yet learned its cost is fragile as morning frost. They mistook the gift for their own achievement, and in that error planted the seed of all that would follow.</p>

<h3>IV. The Fall from Grace</h3>
<p>I write these words with ash upon my fingers and grief upon my heart. Let no reader take joy in this account, for it tells of how we broke the world with our pride. Know that the flames which consumed our armies still burn in my memory, and the voice of Taninsam echoes still in my dreams. May this record serve as warning: the gods grant gifts, but they also demand reckoning.</p>
<p>- Written in penance by Brother Mathias of the Ember Covenant, sole surviving witness of Nortaq, in the first winter of the Age of Silence</p>
<p>4:1 Know this truth, seeker of wisdom: peace among the unenlightened is but a fleeting shadow, for where there is difference without understanding, there is the seed of conflict; where there is abundance without gratitude, there is the root of greed.</p>
<p>4:2 Centuries into the Age of Magic, the harmony between the races began to fray. Not suddenly, as a rope cut by blade, but slowly, as a garment worn thin by friction and time.</p>
<p>4:3 The High Elves and Dwarves, who had grown close in the building of wonders, began to see themselves as the true inheritors of Aedelore&#x27;s gifts. In their pride, they forgot that inheritance is not the same as ownership.</p>
<p>4:4 They withdrew from the Orcs and Trolls, whose ways they could not understand. Know that fear of the different is the first step toward hatred, and hatred is the door through which all darkness enters.</p>
<p>4:5 The Orcs and Trolls, cast out from councils they had once attended, nursed wounds that festered in isolation. What began as confusion hardened into resentment; resentment kindled into rage.</p>
<p>4:6 Know that no fire ignites without fuel. The cruelty of exclusion fed the flames of war as surely as oil feeds flame.</p>
<p>4:7 The Orcs forged dark alliance with the Trolls, and together they descended upon Lorenzia - the City of Starlight, jewel of the Elven realm. For fifty years the siege endured.</p>
<p>4:8 Hear this truth: a generation was born and raised knowing nothing but war. Children grew to warriors, warriors fell to dust, and still the killing continued. The land itself began to sicken.</p>
<p>4:9 The earth cried out in agony, its magic curdling under the weight of so much bloodshed. And in their dreaming, deep within Thorsheim, the Dragon Gods heard the weeping of their creation.</p>
<p>4:10 Taninsam and Tohu awoke, and their hearts were heavy with sorrow. They had given these children magic and abundance, beauty and wonder - and the children had filled their garden with graves.</p>
<p>4:11 Taninsam, his divine fury unmatched, soared across the battle-scarred land. His shadow darkened the sun; his passage left the air crackling with the promise of judgment.</p>
<p>4:12 Know that the wrath of gods is not like the wrath of mortals. It is patient, vast, and absolute. It does not negotiate.</p>
<p>4:13 His voice thundered across the heavens: cease your bloodshed or face the Eternal Flame. The Elves and Dwarves, awestruck, laid down their weapons. They remembered, in that moment, that they were guests in this world.</p>
<p>4:14 But the Orcs and Trolls, their hearts hardened by years of humiliation, refused to yield. Their shamans declared that no dragon would command them - they had spirits of their own.</p>
<p>4:15 Know that pride hardens the heart against wisdom. What the Orcs mistook for courage was merely the inability to bow - even before that which could unmake them.</p>
<p>4:16 They set Lorenzia ablaze and began a westward march of destruction. Every settlement became a pyre; every forest, an inferno.</p>
<p>4:17 Taninsam&#x27;s patience, already strained, shattered completely. His eyes blazed with the fury of the Black Sun itself as he descended, his heart set upon judgment.</p>
<p>4:18 At the town of Nortaq, Tohu joined her brother, weaving walls of force that none could breach. They trapped all the warring armies - friend and foe alike - within a single inescapable prison.</p>
<p>4:19 And Taninsam spoke with a voice that shook the foundations of the world: For your betrayal of the sacred gift of life, you shall all perish in my eternal flame!</p>
<p>4:20 Know that in this moment, annihilation was certain. The Divine does not make idle threats.</p>
<p>4:21 Yet from the trembling masses stepped a lone figure - Lordean, a High Elven priest who had glimpsed the Divine Light in his meditations and understood the true nature of the gods.</p>
<p>4:22 He knelt before the dragons, his robes stained with blood, his face marked by grief, and spoke: Take my life and the lives of my soldiers, but spare the innocent who dwell in peace. Let Aedelore be reborn.</p>
<p>4:23 Know that this is the mystery of sacrifice: one soul, freely offered, may weigh more upon the scales than thousands taken by force.</p>
<p>4:24 Taninsam saw in Lordean&#x27;s heart true remorse, true understanding. After a moment that stretched into eternity, the god of fire relented - accepting the sacrifice in place of total destruction.</p>
<p>4:25 With a breath of sacred fire, he consumed the gathered armies. So fierce was the divine wrath that the land itself burned eternally, scorched so deeply it would never heal.</p>
<p>4:26 This marked the end of the Age of Magic - written in fire upon the face of Aedelore.</p>
<p>4:27 But Tohu was burdened by grief. She felt she had failed to protect her gift from those unworthy of its power. In her sorrow, she withdrew the light of magic from all the races.</p>
<p>4:28 And she proclaimed: Only those who prove themselves worthy through wisdom and virtue shall regain the gift of the arcane. Until that day, you are but shadows of what you might have been.</p>
<p>4:29 Know that this was not cruelty but mercy. For magic in the hands of those who had proven themselves unready would only lead to greater destruction. The silence was a teaching, not a punishment.</p>
<p>4:30 Thus ended the First War, and thus began the Age of Silence - when the veil between worlds grew thick, and mortals learned, through absence, the value of what they had squandered.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>V. The Age of Silence</h3>
<p>From darkness, we emerged. From sorrow, we were shaped. Yet know that silence is not emptiness - it is the womb of transformation, the pause between breaths of the Divine. What follows speaks of the long veiling, when the Light withdrew behind clouds of grief, and mortals walked in shadow, learning through absence what they had failed to cherish in abundance.</p>
<p>- Compiled by Helena of Tyralia, First Human Chronicler, who heard these truths whispered by the wind through ancient stones</p>
<p>5:1 Hear now of the Age of Silence, that twilight between judgment and renewal, for though mortals name it an ending, know that it was in truth a beginning - the painful birth of wisdom from the ashes of folly.</p>
<p>5:2 The veil between worlds grew thick as mountain stone, and the Divine Light, which once flowed freely as water, withdrew into hidden channels beneath the earth. Yet it did not depart - it merely waited for hearts worthy to receive it once more.</p>
<p>5:3 Know that Tohu&#x27;s curse was not vengeance but teaching. For magic wielded without wisdom is fire given to children - it consumes what it should warm. In withholding her gift, she preserved both the gift and those who would one day prove worthy of it.</p>
<p>5:4 The races, humbled by divine wrath, turned inward. And in this turning they discovered truths that abundance had hidden: that strength lies not in power alone, but in the wisdom to know when not to use it.</p>
<p>5:5 Yet transformation has its price. For some among the Elves, the weight of sorrow was too great to bear. Their immortal spirits, unable to contain such grief, began to change.</p>
<p>5:6 Know this mystery: the first Humans were not created but transformed - Elves whose souls, crushed beneath the burden of witnessing divine judgment, shed their immortality as a serpent sheds its skin.</p>
<p>5:7 What emerged was neither lesser nor greater, but different - mortal, urgent, burning with a fire unknown to the long-lived. For they had learned that time is precious only when it can be lost.</p>
<p>5:8 These transformed ones were cast out by their former kindred, who saw in them a mirror of their own fallen nature. Yet in exile they found purpose, and from purpose they built Seywald, first city of Humanity.</p>
<p>5:9 And so the pattern repeated, as patterns do: from rejection came resilience, from loss came longing, from longing came the drive to build, to grow, to become more than what they had been.</p>
<p>5:10 For what is a Human but an Elf who has learned that endings give meaning to beginnings? What is mortality but the gift of urgency?</p>
<p>5:11 The Dwarves, children of stone and patience, deepened their craft in the silence. Their hammers spoke prayers to the earth, and in their forges they found meditation. What they could not find in magic, they discovered in the perfection of form.</p>
<p>5:12 The Orcs and Trolls retreated to the harsh lands, where survival itself became their teacher. Know that suffering shapes as surely as any forge - and what emerged from those years of exile was harder, colder, and filled with a hunger that would not be forgotten.</p>
<p>5:13 As centuries passed, the scars upon the land began to heal. Forests reclaimed the ash, rivers found new paths through wounded earth. Yet some wounds cut too deep - there remained places where nothing would grow, where the very stones remembered fire.</p>
<p>5:14 And in the depths of the Lake of Shadows, something stirred in its long sleep, disturbed by dreams of blood yet to be spilled. But this truth was hidden from all who walked above.</p>
<p>5:15 Know that peace built upon unhealed wounds is but a pause in the storm. The races rebuilt their cities and their lives, yet the old divisions remained, buried like embers beneath ash - waiting for wind to fan them into flame once more.</p>
<p>5:16 For the silence was not resolution. It was preparation.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>VI. The Children of the Earth</h3>
<p>The tall folk write their histories in books of paper and towers of stone. We write ours in the rings of trees and the songs of streams. What follows was never meant for outsiders, for some truths lose their power when spoken to ears that cannot truly hear. Yet the time of hiding has passed. Know that we emerged not from war or divine decree, but from the gentle dreaming of the earth itself - and what we guard, we guard for all.</p>
<p>- Sung into memory by Bramblefoot Willowmere, Rootspeaker of the Alfwyld, beneath the Great Tree at the turning of the seasons</p>
<p>6:1 Know that during the long silence, when magic withdrew from the world like tide from shore, there remained one place where the waters never fully receded.</p>
<p>6:2 In the shadow of the Great Tree of Morningstar, where the roots drink deep of the Divine Light, a pocket of the old world persisted - unchanged, untouched by the sorrows that scarred the lands beyond.</p>
<p>6:3 And from this sacred soil, in the way that mushrooms emerge after rain, the Halflings arose. They were not created by decree, nor shaped by conscious will. They simply became - as naturally as flowers bloom, as inevitably as dawn follows darkness.</p>
<p>6:4 Hear this mystery: the Halflings were not given the earth&#x27;s magic. They were the earth&#x27;s magic given form. Where the Elves wielded power and the Dwarves shaped it, the Halflings simply were it.</p>
<p>6:5 They did not learn to speak with trees; they remembered conversations begun before they had mouths to speak. They did not study the songs of streams; they recognized melodies their souls had always known.</p>
<p>6:6 Know that this is why they built no towers reaching toward heaven - they had no need to reach for what already dwelt within them. Their homes were hollows in living wood, burrows in welcoming earth, shelters that grew rather than were constructed.</p>
<p>6:7 For countless turnings of the seasons, they knew nothing of the world beyond their valley. The wars, the judgment, the long silence - these were tales carried on winds they did not follow.</p>
<p>6:8 Yet isolation is not innocence. The Halflings understood truths that the elder races had forgotten in their striving: that power means nothing without purpose, that wisdom lies in knowing what not to do.</p>
<p>6:9 They felt the land&#x27;s pain as their own. When distant forests burned, they wept without knowing why. When rivers ran foul with the residue of war, they sickened in their deepest being.</p>
<p>6:10 Know that this connection was both gift and burden. To be one with the earth is to share its wounds. The Halflings carried scars they had not earned, grief for losses they had never witnessed.</p>
<p>6:11 When magic began to stir once more - that first faint pulse of returning light - they felt it before any other race could perceive it. The Great Tree trembled, and they trembled with it.</p>
<p>6:12 They knew then that their long seclusion was ending. The world beyond their valley was awakening, and it would need what they had preserved through the darkness.</p>
<p>6:13 Yet they also sensed a shadow gathering - something responding to the returning light as predator responds to prey. The old balance was shifting, and not all that stirred was benevolent.</p>
<p>6:14 Know this truth, which the Halflings understood in their bones: light and shadow are bound together. One cannot return without the other following. The magic they had guarded would draw not only seekers of wisdom, but hunters of power.</p>
<p>6:15 And so they prepared - not for war, which they could not wage, but for the task they had always been shaped to fulfill: to stand at the threshold and speak the Words that hold the darkness at bay.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>VII. The Rising Shadow</h3>
<p>The shadow does not announce itself with trumpets. It seeps through cracks in the light, pools in hollows of forgotten places, and grows strong in hearts that have known only rejection. What follows is not merely a chronicle of gathering war, but a teaching on the nature of that which opposes the Divine - for the shadow is not the absence of light, but light that has forgotten its source.</p>
<p>- Revealed to Faelyn Swiftarrow, Warden of the Northern Watch, in visions that came between sleeping and waking</p>
<p>7:1 Know that resentment is a seed that grows in darkness. The Orcs and Trolls, cast out and diminished, had nursed their wounds through centuries of silence. And wounds untended do not heal - they fester.</p>
<p>7:2 They beheld the Halflings emerging from their hidden valley, innocent and bright, carrying within them a connection to the land that all others had lost. And in that innocence, they saw not beauty but opportunity.</p>
<p>7:3 For their shamans had read forbidden texts, tablets carved in ages before memory, which spoke of a people who would hold the key to magic&#x27;s return. They believed the Halflings to be these prophesied ones.</p>
<p>7:4 Know this truth: those who seek power through force understand only taking. They could not comprehend that the Halflings&#x27; gift was not a treasure to be seized, but a harmony to be shared.</p>
<p>7:5 And so they descended upon the peaceful villages with fire and blade, believing they could cut wisdom from flesh as one cuts ore from stone. In this error lay the seed of their own undoing.</p>
<p>7:6 The Halflings fled before them, for they had built no walls and forged no weapons. Yet the land itself sheltered them - paths opened where none had been, roots lifted to trip the invaders, and the forest swallowed their tracks.</p>
<p>7:7 For what the Orcs did not understand was this: the Halflings did not possess the land&#x27;s magic. They were the land&#x27;s magic. To harm them was to harm Aedelore itself.</p>
<p>7:8 The Great Tree of Morningstar trembled at the violence done to its children. And through roots that spread beneath all the world, it sent warning to those with ears to hear.</p>
<p>7:9 The Elves heard, and remembered their ancient duty. The Dwarves heard, and took up hammers that had long rested. Even the Humans, youngest of the races, felt the stirring in their transformed blood.</p>
<p>7:10 Yet hear this warning, seeker of wisdom: not all shadows come from without. The Orcs&#x27; hatred was born from the cruelty they had suffered. The darkness that drove them had first been done unto them.</p>
<p>7:11 For what is evil but wounded good? What is hatred but love that has been betrayed? In the enemy&#x27;s heart beats the same spark that burns in the hero&#x27;s breast - twisted, perhaps, but never entirely extinguished.</p>
<p>7:12 This truth the Halflings knew. And though they called for aid in battle, in their hearts they sought another way - a path of healing rather than victory, of restoration rather than revenge.</p>
<p>7:13 But the wheel of war, once set in motion, is not easily stopped. And darker forces than Orcs were stirring, drawn by the scent of blood yet to be spilled.</p>

<h3>VIII. The Siege of Rivermount</h3>
<p>I have buried friends today. I will bury more tomorrow. Yet in the midst of death, I have glimpsed a truth that battles alone cannot teach: that every drop of blood spilled upon sacred ground speaks to powers beneath, and that war itself can be a ritual - though those who wage it know not what they invoke.</p>
<p>- Recorded in the journal of Captain Aldric Stormblade, Lutovian Third Regiment, who understood only later what his words foretold</p>
<p>8:1 Hear now of the Siege of Rivermount, for in this battle lies hidden a truth darker than any sword could carve: that sometimes victory and defeat wear each other&#x27;s masks, and the winner is not who holds the field, but who achieves their purpose.</p>
<p>8:2 The Orcs came through tunnels long forgotten - the Barrowhills, carved by Dwarven hands in ages past and abandoned to shadow. Through darkness they traveled, beneath the watchful eyes that guarded above.</p>
<p>8:3 Know that what is forgotten does not cease to exist. It merely waits. The tunnels remembered their makers, and whispered of the invaders to those with ears to hear - but the warnings came too late.</p>
<p>8:4 Rivermount stood as a beacon in the northern lands, its silver towers channeling the thin streams of magic that still flowed through Aedelore. If it fell, the light would dim further still.</p>
<p>8:5 The attack came in the hour before dawn, when the veil between sleeping and waking is thinnest. This was no accident - the Orcish shamans knew that power flows most freely in the liminal times.</p>
<p>8:6 Elf and Orc clashed upon the ancient walls. Human steel met Trollish strength in the breaches. Dwarven axes rang against iron in the tunnels below. And above it all, magic crackled like lightning before a storm.</p>
<p>8:7 For days the battle raged without ceasing. The sun rose and set, rose and set, yet still the fighting continued - by torchlight when darkness fell, by spell-light when torches failed.</p>
<p>8:8 The River Letha, sacred waterway of the Elven realm, ran red with the blood of friend and foe alike. And here lies the hidden truth: the river did not end at the city walls.</p>
<p>8:9 It flowed onward, carrying its crimson burden through forest and vale, until it reached the still black waters of the Lake of Shadows. And the Lake remembered what lay beneath.</p>
<p>8:10 Know that blood freely spilled is never merely lost. It speaks. It calls. It feeds. And there are things that have waited long ages for such a feast.</p>
<p>8:11 The defenders fought with courage that songs would later celebrate. The Elves called upon ancient wards, the Humans stood firm in the breaches, the Dwarves held the tunnels against all odds.</p>
<p>8:12 Yet as each warrior fell, as each life poured out upon the sacred ground, the true purpose of the siege drew closer to completion - a purpose none among the defenders could perceive.</p>
<p>8:13 For the Orcs had not come to conquer. They had come to bleed.</p>
<p>8:14 And in the depths beneath the Lake of Shadows, something that had slept since before the First War stirred at the taste of so much death, and began to wake.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>IX. Tears of Blood</h3>
<p>The water speaks to those who listen. It spoke to me of ancient wrongs and stirring darkness, of seals cracking beneath the weight of blood. What I witnessed in my visions I have set down here, though the writing of it brings me no peace. Know that the lake remembers what lies beneath, and now, fed by the river of death, it begins to wake that which should have slept forever.</p>
<p>- Revealed to Sister Morvaine, Oracle of the Veiled Waters, in trance-visions that left her blind for seven days</p>
<p>9:1 Know that blood is never merely blood. It carries memory, intention, the echo of the life it sustained. Blood spilled in violence speaks a language older than words.</p>
<p>9:2 As the battle for Rivermount raged, the blood of the fallen flowed freely - Elf and Orc, Human and Troll, Dwarf and beast. The River Letha received them all without judgment.</p>
<p>9:3 Day after day, the sacred river carried its crimson burden through forest and vale. Its waters, once crystal clear, grew dark with the testimony of war.</p>
<p>9:4 Know that rivers remember their course. The Letha flowed as it had always flowed - onward, downward, toward the still black waters of the Lake of Shadows.</p>
<p>9:5 Beneath that dark mirror lay the ruins of a place spoken of only in whispers - the Sunken City, swallowed by the waters in ages beyond memory for sins that even history had forgotten.</p>
<p>9:6 It is said that the city had once been ruled by Malcath, an Elven king who sought to rival the gods themselves. He had delved into forbidden mysteries, made pacts with entities from the void between worlds.</p>
<p>9:7 Know that those who reach for power beyond their nature invite their own destruction. The land itself turned against Malcath, dragging his civilization into the depths.</p>
<p>9:8 Yet destruction is not always ending. Some things, when drowned, do not die - they merely sleep. And sleeping things may dream. And dreaming things may wake.</p>
<p>9:9 The blood that flowed into the lake was heavy with rage and despair, with the final thoughts of the dying and the hatred of those who killed them. It sank through the dark water like stones.</p>
<p>9:10 Know that in the depths, something stirred. Something that had forgotten its own name in the long darkness, but had never forgotten its hunger.</p>
<p>9:11 The ancient seals that had bound this force began to fracture. They had been made of silence and forgetting - but blood remembers, and blood speaks.</p>
<p>9:12 Each life lost upon the battlefield was another crack in the ancient barriers. Each death, another syllable in an invocation none had meant to speak.</p>
<p>9:13 The waters of the lake began to churn where no wind stirred. Dark tendrils of power coiled through the depths, reaching toward the submerged ruins.</p>
<p>9:14 Know that the defenders above perceived none of this. Their eyes were fixed upon the enemy before them. They could not see the doom rising beneath their feet.</p>
<p>9:15 Yet the creatures of the lake knew. Fish leaped from the water to die upon the shore rather than remain. Birds refused to fly across the surface. The very air grew heavy with dread.</p>
<p>9:16 Then, with a sound like the groaning of the world itself, the lake seemed to cry out. Waves crashed upon distant shores, and from the depths rose a voice - ancient, hungry, pleased.</p>
<p>9:17 Know that what wakes in darkness does not wake gently. It wakes with appetite. And the blood of war had whetted that appetite to a razor&#x27;s edge.</p>
<p>9:18 The sleeper stirred toward consciousness. And in the stirring, the world trembled.</p>

<h3>X. The Forgotten Knowledge</h3>
<p>For generations beyond counting, we have kept what was entrusted to us - not from pride, but from sacred duty. The knowledge we guard is not ours; we are merely its vessels, as the lamp is vessel to the flame. Now the seals crack and the hour grows late. What is written here was never meant for the unready, yet necessity strips away caution. May those who read these words prove worthy of the weight they carry.</p>
<p>- Unsealed from the Hidden Archives by Elder Thistledown Earthsong, when the Great Tree wept sap the color of blood</p>
<p>10:1 Know that there exists knowledge older than the Dragon Gods themselves - truths that were ancient when Taninsam first opened his eyes to the primordial darkness.</p>
<p>10:2 Before the Six shaped Aedelore, before the Black Sun released its gathered light, there were Powers. And where there are Powers, there must be Bindings.</p>
<p>10:3 The Halflings did not discover this knowledge. They were shaped to contain it - vessels formed by the earth itself to hold what no other race could bear.</p>
<p>10:4 Hear now what the Orcs sought and could not understand: the Halflings possessed not spells but Words - sounds that predated language, vibrations that the cosmos itself recognizes and obeys.</p>
<p>10:5 These Words were not learned but remembered. They rose from the dreaming of the earth, passed through Halfling voices, and returned to the silence from which all sound emerges.</p>
<p>10:6 Know that the greatest of these Words is the Word That Binds - the utterance that holds the seams of reality together and keeps that which should not be from passing through.</p>
<p>10:7 Long ago, before the Elves crossed the void, before the Dwarves woke in their mountain cradle, something was sealed beneath the Lake of Shadows. The Halflings knew its name, though they never spoke it aloud.</p>
<p>10:8 The seals were not made of stone or iron. They were made of silence - the absence of the Word that would call the sleeper forth. As long as the silence held, the darkness dreamed.</p>
<p>10:9 Yet blood has its own voice. Blood spilled in violence speaks words that the living cannot hear but the sleeping can. Each death upon the battlefield was a syllable in an invocation none had intended to speak.</p>
<p>10:10 The Halfling elders felt the seals weakening as others feel the coming of a storm - a pressure behind the eyes, a trembling in the bones. They knew what the war was truly accomplishing.</p>
<p>10:11 Know this truth: to reseal what has been opened requires more than the Word. It requires those who embody what the darkness opposes - not power, but purpose; not strength, but willingness to sacrifice.</p>
<p>10:12 The prophecies spoke of such ones - souls marked before birth, drawn by threads invisible to walk paths that would lead them to the place where the choice must be made.</p>
<p>10:13 These were the heroes foretold. Not mighty warriors, though some would wield swords. Not great mages, though some would touch the arcane. They were simply those who, when the moment came, would not turn away.</p>
<p>10:14 The Halflings sent seekers to find them - not with maps, but with listening. For the marked ones could be heard by those who knew how to hear: a resonance in the pattern, a brightness against the gathering shadow.</p>
<p>10:15 The hour grew late. Beneath the Lake, the sleeper stirred toward waking. And across Aedelore, scattered and unknowing, the heroes began to feel the pull of a destiny they had not chosen but could not refuse.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>XI. Victory Through Defeat</h3>
<p>When you read this, the battle will be won and the celebration ended. When you read this, the truth will begin to dawn. I write from a time not yet come, for the gift of foresight is also its curse - to see clearly what others cannot yet perceive. Know that the Orcs have achieved their true purpose. The darkness rises. And only those foretold can stem the tide. Seek the heroes. The hour grows late.</p>
<p>- Left unsigned in the Rivermount Archives, discovered three days after the siege ended, written in ink that had not yet dried though no scribe claimed its authorship</p>
<p>11:1 For weeks the siege had raged, and for weeks the defenders had held. Elf and Human and Dwarf stood shoulder to shoulder against the tide of Orc and Troll.</p>
<p>11:2 Know that courage is not the absence of fear but the choice to stand despite it. The defenders of Rivermount made that choice each dawn, not knowing if they would see another.</p>
<p>11:3 At last, the tide began to turn. The combined might of the alliance proved too great, and the invaders began to falter. Hope kindled in hearts that had known only grim determination.</p>
<p>11:4 With one final push - a coordinated assault from walls and tunnels alike - the Orcs and Trolls were driven from the city&#x27;s approaches. Victory cries rose into the blood-red sky.</p>
<p>11:5 The survivors embraced and wept. They believed the nightmare had ended. They did not yet understand that it had only begun.</p>
<p>11:6 Know this truth, which none among the victors perceived: the Orcs had never intended to conquer Rivermount. Their cunning chieftains had known from the beginning that they could not break the Elven stronghold.</p>
<p>11:7 The siege was not a battle. It was a ritual - a blood-soaked ceremony disguised as war.</p>
<p>11:8 For the Orcish shamans had learned from forbidden texts what blood freely spilled could accomplish. They knew of the seals beneath the Lake of Shadows. They knew how to break them.</p>
<p>11:9 Each warrior who fell, friend and foe alike, was an offering. Each death, a key turning in an ancient lock. The river of blood that flowed toward the lake was not waste - it was payment.</p>
<p>11:10 Know that the greatest deceptions wear the face of the obvious. Who would suspect a war of being anything other than what it appeared?</p>
<p>11:11 The Orcs who retreated from Rivermount grinned through their wounds. They had lost warriors, yes - but warriors could be replaced. What they had purchased with those lives was beyond price.</p>
<p>11:12 Deep beneath the Lake of Shadows, the ancient evil stirred fully toward waking. The seals that had held for ages beyond counting crumbled like rotted wood.</p>
<p>11:13 Know that victory and defeat are sometimes the same thing wearing different masks. The defenders had won the battle. The Orcs had won the war.</p>
<p>11:14 In Rivermount, as celebrations faded into exhaustion, the Elves began to feel tremors beneath their feet. Their mages sensed wrongness in the currents of magic - a darkness gathering, a hunger waking.</p>
<p>11:15 The truth spread in whispers: something was rising from the lake. Something that the oldest texts spoke of only in fragments and warnings.</p>
<p>11:16 Know that there comes a time when the knowledge of scholars is not enough. When ancient evil stirs, it requires more than wisdom to oppose it - it requires heroes.</p>
<p>11:17 The Elves sent word to the Halflings, whose wisdom and connection to the land had been spoken of with reverence. If anyone knew what rose beneath the lake, it would be they.</p>
<p>11:18 The Halflings, already preparing for the coming storm, understood what must be done. The darkness could still be contained - but only through their ancient magic, and only with the aid of those whom prophecy had marked.</p>
<p>11:19 Know that prophecy does not compel - it reveals. The heroes foretold were not chosen because they were mighty, but because they would choose to stand when standing seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>11:20 As the black mist spread across the lake and the earth trembled with the stirring of ancient evil, the Halflings sent seekers to find those marked by destiny.</p>
<p>11:21 Time was running short. If the sleeper fully woke, if it rose from the depths and walked upon the land, no force in Aedelore could oppose it.</p>
<p>11:22 Know that this is always the nature of darkness: it does not announce its coming with trumpets. It seeps, it creeps, it rises while the unwary celebrate victories that were never truly won.</p>
<p>11:23 And so the stage was set for what would follow - the gathering of the marked ones, the journey to the lake, the confrontation with that which should never have woken.</p>
<p>11:24 The heroes were scattered across Aedelore, unknowing of their purpose. The darkness was rising, aware of nothing but its hunger. And between them stood only the Halflings and their ancient words.</p>
<p>11:25 Know that every ending is also a beginning. The Chronicles of the Rivermount Library end here - but the story continues, written now in deeds rather than words.</p>
<p>Thus end the Chronicles of the Rivermount Library, as preserved for those who seek the light. May those who read these words find wisdom, and may the heroes yet arise to face the darkness.</p>
<p>For as the Black Sun teaches: creation and destruction are but two faces of the same eternal truth. From darkness comes light; from death, rebirth. And though the shadows may seem to triumph, know that within every ending lies the seed of a new beginning.</p>
<p>So it was written by the keepers of ancient lore. So it shall remain until the stars themselves grow cold.</p>

<h2>Gods &amp; Legends</h2>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>Auren Vale and the Weave of Tohu</h3>
<p>In the archives of the Arcane Creed, this account is held most sacred, for it tells of the one who first pierced the Veil and brought magic back to mortal hands. Let those who wield the arcane arts read these words with humility, for without Auren Vale, we would remain blind to the Weave that binds all things.</p>
<p>- Preserved in the Tower of Auren Vale, transcribed by Archweaver Celestine during the Third Convocation of Sages</p>
<p>Auren Vale was not born into greatness, nor did he ever seek it. In the days of his youth, he was simply a scholar with a heart full of curiosity and a mind that yearned to understand the deeper mysteries of the world. Magic, in those times, was but a whisper of legend-spoken of in the dark corners of taverns or written in the fading ink of ancient scrolls. Most believed it had been lost forever, a relic of the distant past when gods walked the earth and shaped the fates of mortals.</p>
<p>Yet there were legends that endured-legends of Tohu, the great dragon goddess who had once woven magic into the very fabric of existence. It was said that Tohu was the guardian of balance, a being of immense power who had, in the age of the ancients, bound magic to the earth, sky, and sea. This magic, known as the Living Weave, flowed through all things, unseen by most, but essential to the harmony of the world.</p>
<p>Over time, the Weave had been forgotten, buried beneath layers of mortal ignorance and the passage of centuries. But Auren had heard these stories, and unlike others, he believed there was truth hidden within them. His life&#x27;&#x27;s work became the search for evidence of the Living Weave, the magical essence Tohu had supposedly left behind.</p>
<p>He traveled the length and breadth of Aedelore, poring over ancient texts, studying the natural world, and seeking out the rare few who claimed to have glimpsed something beyond the mundane. For years, his search yielded nothing more than cryptic fragments-until the day he ventured to the cliffs of the Veil Sanctum.</p>
<p>The Veil Sanctum was a place known for its strange phenomena, where reality itself seemed to thin and the boundary between the physical and the mystical blurred into uncertainty. Auren had heard whispers of it from an old sage who claimed that at the Sanctum&#x27;&#x27;s heart, one could still feel the remnants of Tohu&#x27;&#x27;s Weave. Determined beyond all reason, Auren made the perilous journey across treacherous waters to reach the island, and it was here that his destiny would be forever shaped.</p>
<p>As he stood upon the cliffs of the Veil Sanctum, the wind howling around him like the voice of ancient spirits, he felt something he had never felt before-a subtle hum, as if the air itself was alive with hidden purpose. He closed his eyes and reached out with his mind, not knowing exactly what he was searching for but certain that something waited just beyond his grasp.</p>
<p>For hours he stood motionless, his body still as stone, his consciousness reaching deeper and deeper into the world around him. Slowly, ever so slowly, the hum grew stronger, and Auren began to perceive what mortal eyes had not seen for generations-faint strands of light, shimmering in the air like threads of liquid gold. They wove in and out of the rocks, the trees, the very earth itself.</p>
<p>He realized that these were the strands of the Living Weave, the very magic that Tohu had bound to the world at the dawn of creation. His heart raced, but he forced himself to remain calm, to study the Weave without disturbing its delicate patterns. He saw how the threads connected everything, binding the physical and mystical realms together in perfect harmony. For hours he marveled at the beauty and complexity of what he witnessed, understanding for the first time that magic was not merely a tool to be wielded-it was life itself, a force that flowed through all things.</p>
<p>As night fell and stars emerged to witness his transformation, Auren was drawn to the center of the Sanctum, where the strands of the Weave converged in a swirling, radiant nexus of light. It was here that he felt the presence of Tohu herself-not in flesh, but in the very essence of the magic that surrounded him. The air hummed with the dragon goddess&#x27;&#x27;s ancient power, and Auren fell to his knees, overwhelmed by the immensity of what he was witnessing.</p>
<p>In that sacred moment, a vision came to him. He saw Tohu as she had been at the dawn of time-a massive dragon whose scales shimmered like the stars themselves, weaving magic into the world with every motion of her divine form. The goddess&#x27;&#x27;s voice echoed in his mind, deep and resonant, like the rumble of distant thunder across an endless sky:</p>
<p>&quot;To know the Weave is to know the balance of creation. Magic is not a gift, nor a curse-it is life itself, and it is to be respected, nurtured, and guarded. Those who seek to wield it without understanding will bring ruin, but those who seek to protect it will preserve the harmony of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Auren understood, in that moment of revelation, the enormity of the responsibility that had been placed upon him. He had found the source of the arcane, the very force that Tohu had woven into existence, and now it was his duty to become its steward. He would not only learn to wield the magic of the Living Weave, but he would teach others to respect it, to honor the balance that Tohu had created.</p>
<p>With the knowledge of the Weave burning bright within his transformed consciousness, Auren rose to his feet at the nexus of the Sanctum. He raised his hand, and for the first time in mortal memory, he spoke the words of an ancient spell-a spell he had learned not from books, but from the Weave itself. The air around him shimmered in response, and the strands of light twisted and danced, acknowledging his command. A single spark of pure light leapt from his hand, soaring into the night sky like a fallen star returning to the heavens.</p>
<p>It was a simple spell, nothing more than a flicker of power, but it was the beginning of something far greater. It was the first magic worked by mortal hands since Tohu had withdrawn her gift in grief. It was the dawn of a new age.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Auren Vale would become the first true wielder of arcane magic in the renewed world, and he would go on to found the Arcane Creed-an order dedicated to the study and ethical use of magic. He taught others to respect the Weave, to understand that magic was not a tool for power or selfish ambition, but a force of life that must be guarded and preserved.</p>
<p>Through Auren&#x27;&#x27;s guidance, the world of Aedelore would once again come to understand the true nature of magic, and the balance that Tohu had woven into existence would be protected for generations to come.</p>
<p>And so the legend of Auren Vale, the First Wielder of Arcane Power, was born-a legend that would be passed down through the ages, a reminder that magic is not to be wielded lightly, but with wisdom, restraint, and above all, respect for the sacred balance of the world.</p>

<h3>Malcath: The Lost King of The Sunken City</h3>
<p>This record is kept under seal, for the tale of Malcath is not one to be shared lightly. It speaks of pride and corruption, of a king who sought to rival the divine and was consumed by the very darkness he embraced. Let those who read these words take heed: the pursuit of power without wisdom leads only to the abyss.</p>
<p>- Recovered from the ruins of the Sunken City Library by Archivist Theron Blackwood, who returned from the expedition changed and would speak no more of what he witnessed in the depths</p>
<p>In the ancient city that mortals now speak of only as the Sunken City, where once the shimmering waters of the Iridescent River flowed past towering spires of crystal and marble, there ruled an Elven king named Malcath. In those distant days, the city was renowned throughout Aedelore for its beauty-a place where the light of the dragon goddess Tohu was said to bless the land, making its people wise, powerful, and attuned to the deep mysteries of existence.</p>
<p>And Malcath, the golden-haired sovereign with eyes like polished amber, was beloved by his people for bringing peace and prosperity to their realm. Under his reign, the elves of the city flourished, mastering the arts of magic, diplomacy, and crafting. He was revered not only for his wisdom but for his devotion to the goddess Tohu, whose name he invoked in every council and whose blessing he sought before every decision.</p>
<p>However, despite his outward perfection, Malcath harbored an inner restlessness that gnawed at his immortal soul. It was not enough for him to be merely a king-he dreamed of becoming something more. He sought immortality beyond even elven measure, and power that would place him among the divine themselves.</p>
<p>Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s ambition was subtle at first, hidden even from his own heart. It began as mere curiosity-pondering the nature of godhood, wondering what it would mean to ascend beyond mortal limitations. He began researching forgotten magics in the darkest corners of his great library, poring over ancient tomes that spoke of forbidden powers long hidden from the world.</p>
<p>It was during one such night of secret study that a figure emerged from the shadows themselves-Zarathen, an ancient entity bound to the void between worlds, a being of pure darkness that had slumbered since before the dragons shaped the earth. Zarathen whispered promises of transcendence into Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s eager ear, offering knowledge that could make the elven king rival even the gods themselves.</p>
<p>Though Malcath initially resisted, knowing in some distant corner of his heart that this path led to damnation, the temptation proved too great. He saw himself not merely as ruler of one city, but as a being of ultimate power, beyond the reach of any deity, beyond the judgment of any force. With Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s forbidden teachings, he believed he could attain godhood and rule not just his realm, but the entirety of Aedelore.</p>
<p>In secret chambers beneath his palace, Malcath began the forbidden rites that Zarathen had taught him. These rituals demanded terrible sacrifices-not just offerings of gold or blood, but the very life force of his land and people. Malcath drained the magical essence from the earth that had sustained his kingdom, drawing power from the same source that had made his city a beacon of light.</p>
<p>With each dark ritual, the Iridescent River grew darker. The once-vibrant forests surrounding the city withered and turned to ash. The magic that had blessed the land for generations began to curdle and corrupt. Though his subjects noticed the gradual decay, they could not imagine their beloved king as its cause. Only Eryndor, Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s most trusted advisor and a mage of great renown, sensed the terrible change in his sovereign.</p>
<p>Eryndor, loyal to both king and goddess, pleaded with Malcath to abandon his dark path. But the king, his soul already twisted by Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s influence, dismissed the warnings as the fears of a lesser being who could not comprehend the glory that awaited. When Eryndor discovered the true nature of the forbidden rituals, he gathered the council of elders and confronted the king directly.</p>
<p>Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s response was swift and terrible. Enraged by what he perceived as betrayal, he unleashed his newfound power upon the council chamber, slaying the elders in a storm of shadow and corrupted flame. Eryndor alone escaped, fleeing the city to warn the neighboring kingdoms of Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s descent into madness.</p>
<p>With all opposition silenced, Malcath prepared for the final ritual of ascension-a ceremony of such darkness that it would shatter the boundaries between mortal and divine. The cost would be the complete destruction of his city, the sacrifice of every remaining soul, and the draining of the river that had sustained his people since the founding of their realm.</p>
<p>And so Malcath ascended the Great Tower of his city, raising his arms to channel the spell that would grant him godhood at the price of everything he had once ruled. The sky darkened as power gathered around him, and the earth itself trembled in anticipation of the catastrophe to come.</p>
<p>It was then that Tohu herself descended from the celestial realm. The dragon goddess appeared in radiance that burned away the gathering shadows, her form terrible and beautiful beyond mortal comprehension. She offered Malcath a final chance for redemption-a moment to turn away from the abyss and atone for his sins against creation.</p>
<p>But Malcath, his soul irrevocably corrupted by Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s darkness, rejected her mercy with laughter that echoed like thunder. He believed himself beyond salvation, beyond consequence-a being destined to surpass even the gods who had created the world.</p>
<p>Tohu, with sorrow that shook the foundations of existence, unleashed her divine power to stop the mad king. But the dark magic Malcath had woven around himself proved stronger than even she had anticipated, bolstered by centuries of Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s patient corruption. In a final, desperate act to save the world from the horror he would unleash, Tohu severed Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s soul from his physical form, casting his consciousness into the void between dimensions.</p>
<p>His body was torn apart by the conflicting forces of divine light and abyssal darkness, but his soul-twisted beyond recognition-became bound to the shadows he had so eagerly embraced. The ritual, interrupted but not entirely stopped, released enough corrupted energy to doom the city. The earth opened beneath the towers, and the waters of the Iridescent River-now black with corruption-rushed in to claim what remained.</p>
<p>The Sunken City, once a beacon of beauty and magical achievement, vanished beneath the waves. Its people, those who had not already fled, were consumed by the cataclysm their king had wrought. The waters that cover the ruins remain dark to this day, tainted by the residue of Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s ambition.</p>
<p>Yet the tale does not end with the drowning of a kingdom. Though his body was destroyed, Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s soul endures in the void, forever seeking a way back to the world of the living. It is said that he still hungers for the godhood he was denied, that his influence can be felt in the dark corners of Aedelore where forbidden knowledge waits to tempt the ambitious.</p>
<p>Some whisper that his voice can be heard in the dreams of those who dabble in dark magic, urging them to continue the work he started, promising them power beyond imagination in exchange for their service.</p>
<p>The elves remember Malcath not as the king he once was, but as the cautionary tale he became-a symbol of what happens when ambition blinds even the wisest of rulers. His name, once spoken with reverence throughout the land, is now uttered only in fear and warning.</p>
<p>And beneath the black waters of the Lake of Shadows, the Sunken City waits. Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s presence lingers there still, patient as the darkness itself, waiting for the day when blood and chaos might weaken the seals and allow him to rise again.</p>

<h3>Lordean and the great price for life</h3>
<p>This account is read aloud each year at the Festival of Remembrance, when the peoples of Aedelore gather to honor those who fell in the First War. Of all the heroes whose names are spoken on that solemn day, none commands greater reverence than Lordean, who gave everything so that others might live. May his sacrifice never be forgotten.</p>
<p>- Inscribed upon the Altar of Atonement in the rebuilt Temple of Lorenzia, maintained by the Order of the Eternal Flame</p>
<p>In the heart of Lorenzia, that city of starlight and ancient sorrow, there lived a priest whose name would become synonymous with the highest form of sacrifice. Lordean, born to a noble house but called to serve powers greater than any bloodline, devoted his existence to the teachings of harmony among the races of Aedelore. His deep-rooted belief in unity, compassion, and the sanctity of all life guided him through the complexities of elven society and the troubled times that would test every principle he held sacred.</p>
<p>As the Age of Magic began its slow descent into shadow, the tensions between the great races of Aedelore escalated beyond all hope of peaceful resolution. The harmony that had once blessed Lorenzia and the lands beyond began to unravel, as misunderstandings and ancient grievances transformed into open hostility.</p>
<p>Lordean, watching his beloved world crumble into chaos, worked tirelessly to mediate peace. He traveled between the camps of the warring factions, calling upon High Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and Trolls alike to remember their shared history, to honor the bonds that had once united them in wonder at Aedelore&#x27;&#x27;s beauty. He pleaded with leaders on all sides to step back from the precipice of annihilation.</p>
<p>But his words fell upon ears deafened by hatred. The allure of vengeance had consumed too many hearts, and soon the fragile peace shattered completely. Lorenzia, the City of Starlight, was engulfed in the flames of a war that would rage for fifty terrible years.</p>
<p>Lordean remained in his city through the long siege, ministering to the wounded and dying, offering what comfort he could as the streets once filled with laughter became rivers of blood. He watched the beautiful spires of his home crumble beneath the assault, heard the cries of children replace the songs of celebration, and felt his hope dim with each passing year of carnage.</p>
<p>Yet even as despair gripped the hearts of those around him, something within Lordean would not surrender. He sensed, with the intuition granted to those who have glimpsed divine truth, that the suffering of the world had grown so great that even the sleeping gods could not ignore it.</p>
<p>When Taninsam and Tohu awoke from their ancient slumber and descended upon the battlefield at Nortaq, their divine fury shaking the foundations of the world, Lordean understood that he stood at the pivotal moment of history. The dragon gods had come not to save, but to judge-and their judgment would be fire and annihilation.</p>
<p>The surviving armies-Elves and Dwarves who had pursued their enemies, Orcs and Trolls who had refused to yield-found themselves trapped within walls of divine force, facing the wrath of gods they had foolishly defied. Taninsam&#x27;&#x27;s voice thundered across the heavens, promising to burn everything they had built, everyone they had loved, until nothing remained but ash and memory.</p>
<p>It was in this moment of ultimate catastrophe that Lordean stepped forward from the trembling masses. The priest, his robes stained with the blood of those he had tried to save, his face marked by years of grief and sleepless nights, walked alone toward the towering forms of the dragon gods.</p>
<p>He knelt in the scorched earth before beings whose power could unmake the world, and he spoke with a voice that somehow carried above the crackling of divine flames:</p>
<p>&quot;Mighty ones, for the sins we have committed against the sacred order of creation, I offer my life as atonement. Take mine and the lives of the soldiers who have wrought this devastation, but spare the innocent who dwell in peace far from these bloodied fields. Go to them, teach them of our failures, and let Aedelore be reborn from our ashes. For this chance at redemption, I willingly offer myself and my warriors as sacrifice.&quot;</p>
<p>The air itself seemed to hold its breath as Taninsam considered the priest&#x27;&#x27;s words. In Lordean&#x27;&#x27;s heart, the dragon god saw something that gave him pause-not defiance, but true remorse. Here knelt one who understood the magnitude of what had been done, who accepted the terrible cost of redemption without seeking to escape his share of it.</p>
<p>After a moment that stretched into eternity, Taninsam accepted the offering. He commanded Tohu to seal the boundaries of the killing ground, ensuring that none would escape the judgment to come. Then, with a breath of sacred fire that the survivors in distant lands would see lighting the horizon, he consumed the gathered armies.</p>
<p>Lordean felt the flames engulf him, felt the searing agony that ended his mortal existence. But in that moment of ultimate sacrifice, he experienced something that transcended pain-a profound peace, a certainty that his offering had been accepted, that his death would purchase life for countless innocents who would never know his name.</p>
<p>The fire burned so fiercely that the land itself was scorched for eternity, a permanent scar upon the face of Aedelore. When the flames finally died, nothing remained of the armies but ash-and from those ashes, no new life would ever grow.</p>
<p>But beyond the circle of devastation, the world continued. The innocent survived. The children who had been spared would grow to rebuild what had been destroyed, wiser for the terrible lessons their forebears had learned.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, the dragon gods walked among the survivors throughout Aedelore, commanding them to remember the price of strife. They spoke of Lordean and his sacrifice, ensuring that his name would be honored through all the ages to come.</p>
<p>Today, the tale of Lordean-the High Elven priest who gave his life for the salvation of a world-is told wherever the peoples of Aedelore gather to reflect upon the past. His sacrifice did not end war forever, for such is the nature of mortal hearts. But it stands as an eternal reminder that even in the darkest hour, one soul&#x27;&#x27;s choice can change the fate of everything.</p>
<p>May his light never fade from memory. May his courage inspire all who must choose between self and sacrifice. And may the world he died to save prove worthy of the price he paid.</p>

<h3>Nyxora: Born of Shadow and Void</h3>
<p>What follows was spoken in whispers by the shadow-seers of the Obsidian Sanctum, those who dare to gaze into the dark spaces between stars. Their words were transcribed by one who walked the boundary between light and void, and lived to tell of what he witnessed. Let those who fear the night read no further.</p>
<p>- Recorded by Shadowseer Vanthros, Keeper of the Midnight Archives, in the forty-third year of the Veiled Moon</p>
<p>In the boundless expanse of the cosmos, in that terrible hour after the cataclysmic battle between Zelgor, the Harbinger of Chaos, and Taninsam, the God of Fire, the universe lay in fragments like shattered glass across the void. The chaotic energies unleashed during their clash resonated across all realms, birthing new forces and entities from the wounded fabric of creation itself. From this maelstrom of darkness, from the very wounds torn in the body of existence, a profound creation emerged: Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen, a goddess of darkness and illusion, sculpted from the shadows themselves and the echoes of Zelgor&#x27;&#x27;s fury.</p>
<p>The battle between Zelgor and Taninsam had left an indelible mark upon the cosmos, a scar that would never fully heal. Taninsam, consumed by his righteous rage, had scorched the landscape with flames that burned beyond mortal comprehension, boiling the earth and setting the very firmament ablaze. In contrast, Zelgor reveled in the chaos as a serpent delights in the coiling of its own body, his dark energy spreading like a tempest across dimensions, reshaping the fabric of reality with each devastating stroke.</p>
<p>Yet, amidst his victory, Zelgor felt an emptiness that gnawed at the core of his being-a void within the void. The darkness he thrived upon lacked form, purpose, and beauty. It was a hungry emptiness that yearned to be filled with something more than mere destruction. In this moment of introspection, as he surveyed the smoldering remnants of the world with eyes like dying stars, Zelgor began to contemplate the nature of his own existence.</p>
<p>&quot;Chaos, in its rawest form, is but a tool,&quot; he mused, his voice echoing through dimensions. &quot;It needs a partner, a reflection of its complexity, a mirror in which to see its own terrible beauty.&quot; Thus was the seed of creation planted in the mind of the Destroyer.</p>
<p>The Birth of the Shrouded Queen</p>
<p>Zelgor gathered the swirling remnants of chaos as a weaver gathers threads of silk, shaping them into a dense fog that glimmered with infinite potential. With a wave of his hand that sent ripples through the fabric of existence, he infused the darkness with his own essence, guiding it into a new form that had never before existed in all the ages of creation.</p>
<p>From the abyss emerged Nyxora, enveloped in shadows that danced around her form like ethereal wisps of forgotten dreams. Her eyes shimmered with the light of countless stars obscured by eternal night, holding within them mysteries that predated the first dawn. She was unlike anything the cosmos had witnessed in all its long ages: a being of terrible beauty and profound enigma, embodying the delicate balance between light and dark, chaos and order, destruction and creation.</p>
<p>Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s first breath sent ripples through the void, causing distant stars to flicker in recognition of her awakening. She gazed upon her creator with a mixture of awe and curiosity that reflected the very nature of shadow itself-always seeking, always questioning, always dancing at the edge of revelation.</p>
<p>&quot;Who am I?&quot; she asked, her voice a melodic whisper that echoed through the silence of eternity, carrying with it the weight of a question that would shape the destiny of worlds.</p>
<p>&quot;You are Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen,&quot; Zelgor replied, and in his tone was a hint of pride such as had never before been witnessed in the Harbinger of Chaos. &quot;You are born from the chaos I wield, destined to be the mistress of shadows and illusions, the keeper of all that dwells between light and darkness.&quot;</p>
<p>The Union of Shadow and Chaos</p>
<p>As they interacted across the span of countless ages, a connection formed between Nyxora and Zelgor that transcended the bonds of creator and creation. She was captivated by the chaotic energy that had birthed her, while he was entranced by her mastery over the shadows that he had never truly understood until he saw them dance at her command.</p>
<p>Together, they explored the realms between realms, Nyxora conjuring intricate illusions that dazzled and bewildered even the most ancient beings, while Zelgor reveled in the freedom of chaos that she helped him see with new eyes. In their shared moments, they crafted beautiful realms of darkness, where the shadows danced in patterns of infinite complexity and the illusions painted stories across the night sky that would take mortal minds a thousand lifetimes to comprehend.</p>
<p>Their relationship evolved and blossomed, transforming from the bond of a creator and his creation into something far deeper and more profound. Zelgor began to see Nyxora as more than a reflection of his chaotic nature-she was a partner, an equal who understood the complexities of existence with the same fierce intelligence that burned within his own being.</p>
<p>In a moment of profound connection that shook the foundations of multiple realms, Zelgor proposed a union unlike any other-a celestial marriage, a binding of their essences that would solidify their bond for all eternity and allow them to rule together over the realms they had created from the remnants of chaos.</p>
<p>Under a sky swirling with chaotic energies and shrouded in the most beautiful darkness ever witnessed, they exchanged vows that were heard by beings across a thousand dimensions. Their voices intertwined with the whispers of the void itself, becoming part of the eternal song that underlies all of creation.</p>
<p>&quot;Together, we shall weave a tapestry of shadows and chaos,&quot; Zelgor declared, his voice echoing like thunder in the stillness between worlds. &quot;We will reshape existence, creating a balance that others can only dream of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And in this darkness, we shall find our purpose,&quot; Nyxora replied, her eyes gleaming with determination and love intertwined. &quot;We will create worlds where beauty thrives amidst chaos, and illusion dances eternally in the shadows.&quot;</p>
<p>The Conquest of Borea</p>
<p>Yet even in her union with Zelgor, Nyxora harbored ambitions of her own-a burning desire to carve out a domain that would stand as a monument to their power. In the cold expanse of Borea, a realm shrouded in perpetual winter and echoing with the whispers of ancient spirits, she saw the perfect canvas for her vision.</p>
<p>Her motivations ran deeper than mere conquest. Within her heart burned the desire for vengeance-to reclaim and extend the legacy of Zelgor against those who had opposed him, against the dragon gods whose flames had wounded her beloved in ages past.</p>
<p>With each step upon the frozen earth, the frost trembled beneath her feet. She embraced the icy atmosphere as one embraces a long-lost friend, finding in its stark contrast to her dark essence a beauty that spoke to the deepest parts of her nature. Here, she would weave her dark magic and create a realm where shadows danced in the endless winter night.</p>
<p>But Borea was not unguarded. Two mighty dragon gods watched over this sacred realm: Tatsu, the Enigmatic Dragon God of Souls, and Leviathan, the Mighty Dragon God of Air. They had sworn to protect the balance of Aedelore, and they would not yield their vigilance even to the Shrouded Queen.</p>
<p>The battle that followed shook the frozen realm to its foundations. Nyxora summoned storms of shadows, weaving illusions that twisted the very fabric of reality. The landscape became a chaotic swirl of dark forms, and the air crackled with powers both ancient and terrible.</p>
<p>Yet the dragon gods, united in purpose and power, proved insurmountable. Their combined might cut through Nyxora&#x27;&#x27;s defenses, dispersing her illusions with beams of soul energy and torrents of divine wind. In a final, dazzling explosion of light and darkness, the Shrouded Queen was thrown back, her dreams of conquest shattered like ice beneath a hammer&#x27;&#x27;s blow.</p>
<p>&quot;You sought to conquer, but you have only sown chaos,&quot; Tatsu intoned, his voice carrying both authority and unexpected compassion. &quot;Return to the shadows, Nyxora. Let this land heal.&quot;</p>
<p>With a heart heavy with defeat, Nyxora retreated into the depths of her dark magic. Yet even in her withdrawal, her presence lingered in Borea like a persistent chill, and the shadows themselves seemed to whisper her name-a promise that she would return, more cunning and powerful than before.</p>
<p>For darkness, once summoned, always finds its way back. And in her heart, the embers of ambition and vengeance continued to burn, patient as the eternal night itself.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Noctara: The Veiled Mistress of Shadows</h3>
<p>This testament was discovered in the hidden vaults beneath the Hall of Whispers, written in ink that glows only under starlight. The author&#x27;&#x27;s true name has been lost to time, known only by the sigil of the Silent Hand that marks each page. What follows is the sacred history of the Veiled Mistress, whose path through shadow led her to become guardian of the light.</p>
<p>- Translated from the Cipher of Shadows by Sister Moraveth of the Twilight Order, who spent thirty years decoding these sacred texts</p>
<p>Loraniel stood atop the highest spire of Lutovia, gazing out over the sprawling city that she had once called home. The grand elven architecture shimmered in the twilight, bathed in the soft glow of moonlight that painted silver patterns across ancient stone. It was a city of elegance and light, but to Loraniel, it had become a place of illusion-where truth was hidden behind false smiles and empty words, where corruption festered beneath surfaces of beauty.</p>
<p>Even as a young elf, she had seen the shadows lurking behind the grandeur, sensed the darkness that coiled within the hearts of those who proclaimed themselves servants of light. But it was not until this night, after her transformation, that she truly understood the nature of what she had always perceived.</p>
<p>She had once been one of Lutovia&#x27;&#x27;s most revered priestesses, serving the gods of light and justice with a devotion that knew no bounds. Her path had been set before her birth, her future secured by bloodline and tradition. Yet there was a restlessness in her heart, a questioning spirit that would not be silenced by ritual or dogma.</p>
<p>The teachings of the temples, with their rigid structures and devotion to purity, had begun to feel hollow as empty vessels. While others found peace in the light, Loraniel found only questions that multiplied like shadows at sunset. If the world was truly ruled by justice, why were lies allowed to fester beneath the surface of society? Why did those in power always seem to harbor more secrets than those they claimed to protect?</p>
<p>The Whispers from the Dark</p>
<p>The questions gnawed at her spirit, pulling her away from the life she had been groomed to lead. And then, in the deepest hours of night, the whispers began.</p>
<p>They came to her during her meditations, slipping into her mind like tendrils of shadow through cracks in a sealed door. At first, she thought them figments of her imagination-dark thoughts conjured by her own doubts and fears. But as the nights passed and the moon waxed and waned, the whispers grew stronger, more distinct, more undeniably real.</p>
<p>One evening, while performing a ritual in the temple&#x27;&#x27;s inner sanctum, the voice came to her with crystal clarity: &quot;You see the shadows for what they are, Loraniel. You know the truth hidden beneath the lies. Why cling to the light when your power lies in the dark?&quot;</p>
<p>Startled beyond measure, she dropped the sacred chalice she was holding, watching in horror as the blessed liquid spilled across the marble floor like blood from a wound. No one else had heard the voice, but it had spoken directly to her soul, with a familiarity that sent shivers through her immortal being.</p>
<p>That night, she wandered the streets of Lutovia, lost in thought so deep it bordered on trance. Her feet carried her beyond the city&#x27;&#x27;s boundaries and into the ancient forest that surrounded it, where no torches burned and the only light was starlight filtered through leaves.</p>
<p>In the darkness of the woods, the voice returned: &quot;You are not like them. You see the world for what it truly is. I can give you power-power beyond the light, beyond the lies. You need only follow the shadows.&quot;</p>
<p>Loraniel stopped walking, her breath catching in her throat. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she whispered into the darkness that embraced her.</p>
<p>The pause that followed stretched like an eternity. Then the voice spoke again, gentle yet filled with hidden power: &quot;I am Nyxora, the Veiled One, the keeper of all secrets. And you, Loraniel, are destined for more than this shallow life of pretended virtue.&quot;</p>
<p>The Transformation</p>
<p>In that moment of revelation, Loraniel understood a truth that had been hidden from her since birth. The light had always been a façade, an illusion used to control and manipulate the masses. True power lay in the shadows, where secrets festered, where influence could be wielded without detection, where truth waited to be discovered by those brave enough to seek it.</p>
<p>For weeks, she retreated deeper into the wilderness, forsaking her former life and meditating on the whispers of Nyxora. She let go of her old name, her old identity, and embraced the shadows as a lover embraces their beloved. In time, she learned the ways of the dark goddess, mastering the arts of secrecy, deception, and subtlety that would become her greatest tools.</p>
<p>She learned to blend into shadows as naturally as water flows into a vessel, to walk unseen through crowded halls, and to hear the hidden truths that others tried so desperately to conceal. In her isolation, she became Noctara, the Veiled Mistress of Shadows, no longer bound by the constraints of her former life.</p>
<p>But her transformation was not yet complete. Nyxora had one final test for her chosen servant.</p>
<p>On the night of the new moon, when shadows consumed the world entirely, Noctara was led to a hidden chamber deep beneath the roots of an ancient tree whose age was measured in ages rather than years. There, in utter silence that pressed upon her like the weight of mountains, she sat for three days, listening to the whispers of the darkness, letting the shadows seep into her very being.</p>
<p>When she emerged on the third night, she was no longer the elf she had been. The shadows clung to her like a second skin, and in her eyes flickered the hidden knowledge of the world-every secret, every lie, every truth concealed from the light.</p>
<p>The Founding of the Silent Hand</p>
<p>Returning to the world of the living, Noctara sought out those who, like her, saw beyond the illusions of power and light. She found them in the dark alleys of cities, in the hidden dens of thieves, in the minds of those who lived on the fringes of society-outcasts and seekers who understood that knowledge was the true currency of power.</p>
<p>Together, they formed the Silent Hand, a guild devoted to the teachings of Noctara and the ways of Nyxora. Unlike other organizations that sought to conquer openly or rule through might, they operated in the shadows, gathering secrets, influencing decisions, and shaping events from behind the veil of normalcy.</p>
<p>To join the Silent Hand, initiates had to undergo the same test that Noctara had endured-the Veiling. In utter silence, they would sit for days, meditating on the shadows, listening for the whispers of Nyxora. Only those who could withstand the silence, who could embrace the darkness without fear or madness, were deemed worthy.</p>
<p>The Light Within the Darkness</p>
<p>Yet as the years passed and Noctara&#x27;&#x27;s power grew, a strange understanding began to dawn within her consciousness. It came during one of her meditations in the Hall of Whispers, when the familiar silence was disturbed by a new voice-not the voice of Nyxora or the shadows, but something older and brighter.</p>
<p>&quot;The light cannot stand on its own, nor can the dark. They are intertwined, inseparable, two aspects of the same eternal truth.&quot;</p>
<p>This was not Nyxora speaking. This was something far more ancient, a presence that did not reject the shadows but recognized them as part of a greater whole. In that moment of unexpected revelation, Noctara understood a profound truth that would reshape her purpose.</p>
<p>To serve the light did not mean abandoning the shadows. The true path was one that balanced both, wielding the power of the dark in service of something greater than self. The Silent Hand would become not merely rogues and thieves manipulating the world for gain, but unseen guardians-protectors of Aedelore&#x27;&#x27;s hidden truths, preservers of the balance between light and dark.</p>
<p>When she revealed this new purpose to her followers, there were whispers of dissent. Many had devoted themselves to the darker aspects of Noctara&#x27;&#x27;s teachings and resisted this shift toward service. But she led by example, moving through shadows to expose corruption, thwart conspiracies, and protect the innocent from threats they could never have seen coming.</p>
<p>In the centuries that followed, Noctara&#x27;&#x27;s influence spread far beyond any single kingdom. Her creed embraced a higher calling-one that balanced light and dark, truth and necessary deception, in service to the greater good. The Silent Hand became legendary, its members rumored to be everywhere and nowhere, always acting in shadows, always serving the light in secret.</p>
<p>For Noctara had shown that even in the darkest corners of the world, light could thrive-and that sometimes, the greatest acts of heroism were those that went forever unseen.</p>

<h3>Zelgor: The Shadow Before the Dawn</h3>
<p>These words are forbidden to speak aloud, for they tell of the Harbinger whose very name can draw the attention of forces beyond mortal comprehension. This account was pieced together from fragments found in the ruins of temples destroyed in the First Age, where priests had dared to record what should never have been written. Read with caution, for knowledge of the Void carries its own dangers.</p>
<p>- Compiled by the Conclave of Wardens, who maintain eternal vigil against the return of the Shadow Before the Dawn</p>
<p>Long before the creation of Aedelore was completed, before the mountains were carved by divine hands and the rivers flowed with the essence of life, the cosmos existed in a state of chaotic stillness-a paradox that only the most learned sages can begin to comprehend. It was a time of potential without form, where the raw essence of magic and creation mingled in the dark expanse of the void, waiting for the spark that would bring forth existence.</p>
<p>From this abyss, from the very heart of nothingness itself, a figure emerged-Zelgor, the Harbinger of Shadows, a being born from darkness itself, embodying despair and the unknown. He was not merely a creature of the void; he was the void made conscious, a force of destruction and entropy that sought to unmake what was to be created, to swallow light before it could be born.</p>
<p>His form twisted and flowed like a shadow cast by nothing, ever-changing and elusive, defying the very concept of fixed existence. His eyes shimmered like stars lost in eternal night, holding within them the cold light of worlds that had been consumed before time began to count its passage. It was said that where Zelgor walked, hope withered like flowers touched by frost, and dreams were devoured by an all-consuming darkness that left only emptiness in its wake.</p>
<p>The Light of Creation</p>
<p>In stark contrast to this embodiment of entropy stood Taninsam, the Dragon God of Flame and Life, a force of creation and light whose very essence was the antithesis of all that Zelgor represented. As the world of Aedelore began to take shape from the raw materials of existence, Taninsam breathed life into the cosmos, igniting the first sparks of being that would eventually flourish into all the wonders of creation.</p>
<p>His flames danced through the newly forming realms with joy and purpose, giving birth to the radiant landscapes that would become Aedelore. Where Taninsam walked, vibrant forests grew from barren stone, and the magic of life thrived in countless forms of beauty and wonder. His fire was not the fire of destruction, but the fire of the hearth, the fire that warms, transforms, and gives birth to new possibilities.</p>
<p>But the emergence of Zelgor threatened this delicate process of creation. Drawn to Taninsam&#x27;&#x27;s light as a moth is drawn to flame, the Harbinger of Shadows sought to extinguish it, to plunge the nascent world into eternal night before it could know even a single dawn. He was determined to consume the very essence of creation itself, to prove that darkness was the natural state of all things and that light was merely a temporary aberration.</p>
<p>The First Battle</p>
<p>Thus began the first great conflict of the cosmos-a battle between light and darkness, creation and destruction, hope and despair. Taninsam and Zelgor clashed with powers that shook the foundations of reality itself, their struggle creating ripples that would be felt throughout all subsequent ages.</p>
<p>Taninsam&#x27;&#x27;s flames burned with the fury of a thousand suns, scorching the void and pushing back the encroaching darkness. Yet Zelgor was not easily deterred; his shadows absorbed and corrupted, turning the dragon god&#x27;&#x27;s own power against him in twisted reflections of destruction.</p>
<p>The battle raged across dimensions, through realms that existed and realms that were merely potential. Neither combatant could achieve decisive victory, for they were equals in power if not in purpose-two fundamental forces of existence locked in eternal opposition.</p>
<p>In the end, Zelgor was driven back but not destroyed, for how can one destroy the very concept of darkness? He retreated into the deepest voids between worlds, nursing his wounds and his hatred, waiting for the opportunity to strike again at the light he so despised.</p>
<p>The Legacy of Shadow</p>
<p>Yet even in defeat, Zelgor&#x27;&#x27;s influence left permanent marks upon creation. The chaos unleashed during his battle with Taninsam birthed new beings and forces, including Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen, who emerged from the shadows of his fury. His darkness had seeded the cosmos with potential for shadow that would never be entirely erased.</p>
<p>From his exile in the void, Zelgor continued to reach out to the world he sought to unmake. His whispers found their way into the dreams of the ambitious and the desperate, promising power to those who would serve his cause. Some heard and succumbed; others heard and resisted. But all who encountered even an echo of his influence were forever changed.</p>
<p>The sages who study the forbidden texts speak of Zelgor not as a being who was defeated, but as a force that waits-patient as entropy itself, certain as the final darkness that awaits all things at the end of time. They warn that the Shadow Before the Dawn has not abandoned his purpose, that he watches still from the spaces between existence, seeking always for the weakness in the light.</p>
<p>For in the deepest truth of the cosmos, light and darkness are locked in eternal dance, and neither can exist without the other. Zelgor understands this better than any being in creation, and in that understanding lies his greatest and most terrible power-the knowledge that one day, at the end of all things, darkness will be all that remains.</p>
<p>Until that day, the Harbinger waits. And the wise do not speak his name in the dark.</p>

<h3>Taninsam</h3>
<p>This sacred account of the First Flame is read aloud in the Temple of Eternal Fire on the longest night of each year, when the faithful gather to remember that even in the deepest darkness, the light of creation endures. These words have been preserved unchanged since the founding of the Order of the Sacred Flame, passed from High Priest to High Priest across countless generations.</p>
<p>- Inscribed upon tablets of crystallized flame by High Priest Valorian the Undying, who received these truths in divine vision</p>
<p>Domain: Creation, Fire, Life, and Purity
Symbol: A radiant sun enveloped in flames, often depicted as a dragon encircled by a halo of eternal light</p>
<p>The Sacred Mythos</p>
<p>Taninsam is revered throughout all the lands of Aedelore as the Dragon God of Flame and Life, a deity of immeasurable power who embodies the very forces of creation and vitality that sustain all existence. According to the most ancient lore, preserved in temples of stone and memory, he was born from the primordial flames that ignited the cosmos itself-the first fire that sparked in the void and declared that light would exist where before there had been only darkness.</p>
<p>His essence is tied to the eternal cycle of life in ways that mortal minds can only glimpse in their deepest meditations. He represents the duality of fire itself-that sacred force capable of nurturing and consuming, of warming the frozen and reducing the proud to ash. In his flames are held both the terror of destruction and the promise of rebirth, for nothing in creation escapes the touch of fire, and all things are transformed by its passage.</p>
<p>As Aedelore began to take shape from the raw materials of existence, Taninsam played a pivotal role that no other force could have fulfilled. He soared through the newly formed realms with wings of living flame, breathing life into barren lands that had known only cold stone. He ignited the seeds of magic that would blossom into the vibrant flora and fauna that grace the world to this day.</p>
<p>Wherever his fiery breath touched the earth, beauty flourished beyond mortal imagining. Forests grew tall and lush with leaves that caught the light like emeralds. Rivers sparkled with vitality, carrying the essence of life to every corner of the land. Mountains rose to touch the heavens, their peaks crowned with fire that would burn for eternity as beacons of hope.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Flame God</p>
<p>Taninsam is depicted in the sacred texts as a majestic dragon whose very form defies complete description. His scales shimmer with every hue of flame-from the deep red of dying embers to the brilliant white of the forge&#x27;&#x27;s heart-embodying warmth and strength in equal measure. His eyes hold the light of the first sunrise, and his voice carries the crackle of a thousand hearthfires.</p>
<p>He is known to be benevolent and nurturing to those who honor the sacred balance of creation, yet fierce and unyielding when faced with threats to the life he has sworn to protect. His dual nature reflects the complexity of fire itself-while he is the source of light and illumination, the warmth that sustains life through the coldest winters, he is also a harbinger of necessary destruction when corruption must be purged from the world.</p>
<p>Taninsam is considered above all else a guardian of purity and justice, advocating always for the protection of the innocent and the eradication of evil that would poison the sacred gift of existence. He represents hope and light even in the darkest times, illuminating the path forward when all seems lost. Those who follow his teachings believe he imbues them with courage and strength, guiding them in their eternal struggle against the forces of darkness and corruption.</p>
<p>The First Battle</p>
<p>In the time before time was measured, when Aedelore was still forming from potential into reality, Taninsam faced his greatest challenge-the emergence of Zelgor, the Harbinger of Shadows, who sought to unmake all that the Flame God had created. Their battle shook the foundations of existence itself, as light and darkness clashed in a conflict that would determine whether creation would flourish or be swallowed by the void.</p>
<p>Though the battle ended without decisive victory for either side, Taninsam succeeded in his sacred purpose-he drove back the darkness long enough for creation to take root, for life to begin its eternal journey, for the light of hope to become a permanent part of existence. The scars of that battle remain written in the cosmos, but so too does the triumph of the first flame over the primordial dark.</p>
<p>The Eternal Vigil</p>
<p>To this day, Taninsam maintains his vigil over Aedelore, his flames burning eternal in the hearts of those who keep faith with the principles of creation, life, and purity. His temples stand as beacons of hope throughout the land, and his priests tend sacred flames that have burned uninterrupted since the founding of the first holy sites.</p>
<p>Those who seek his blessing know that Taninsam does not grant power lightly, for fire in untrained hands brings only destruction. But to those who prove themselves worthy-those who understand that the flame must be used to warm, to light, to protect rather than to destroy-the Dragon God of Flame and Life offers his eternal guidance.</p>
<p>For as long as a single flame burns in the darkness, the promise of Taninsam endures: that light will never be entirely extinguished, that life will always find a way to flourish, and that the sacred fire of creation will burn until the end of all things and beyond.</p>

<h3>Leviathan</h3>
<p>These words were carried on the wind itself, caught by the Sky Scribes of the Floating Monastery who have devoted their lives to recording the whispers that ride the highest currents. What follows is the collected wisdom of a thousand wind-listeners, assembled over generations into this single account of the Lord of Storms.</p>
<p>- Gathered by Windkeeper Aethon from the Chronicles of the Eternal Gale, in the monastery that touches the clouds</p>
<p>Domain: Air, Freedom, Storms, and Change
Symbol: A swirling gust of wind encircled by a dragon&#x27;&#x27;s silhouette, representing the boundless and ever-changing nature of the element he commands</p>
<p>The Sacred Mythos</p>
<p>Leviathan, the Mighty Dragon God of Air, is revered throughout Aedelore as a colossal dragon whose wings span the very skies themselves, whose breath stirs the winds that carry life from one corner of the world to another. Emerging from the ether that predated creation itself-that formless realm of pure potential-Leviathan embodies the essence of freedom, movement, and the eternal change that is the heartbeat of existence.</p>
<p>In the ancient myths preserved by the wind-touched seers, he is depicted as a creature of surpassing majesty, whose scales shimmer like the sky at dawn, reflecting shades of infinite blue and burnished gold. His roar can summon tempests that reshape coastlines, yet that same voice can calm the most violent storms to gentle breezes. In this duality lies the profound truth of his nature-that the wind serves life when guided by wisdom, and brings destruction only when balance must be restored.</p>
<p>Legends passed down through countless generations tell of Leviathan soaring high above the realm of Aedelore in the earliest days of creation, breathing life into the winds that sweep across the land to this day. It is said that his very presence can alter the course of clouds, conjure storms from clear skies, and inspire the hearts of all who yearn for adventure and the freedom to seek their own destiny.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Wind Lord</p>
<p>Leviathan is characterized in the sacred texts by his unpredictable yet charismatic nature-as befits one who embodies the element that can never be truly contained or controlled. He embodies the exhilarating spirit of freedom in its purest form, encouraging all who worship him to embrace change rather than fear it, to seek new horizons rather than cling to the familiar.</p>
<p>His essence can be both calming and fierce, reflecting the tranquility of a gentle breeze on a summer morning and the devastating chaos of a violent storm that tears ancient trees from their roots. This duality teaches his followers that the wind is not good or evil, but simply is-a force that responds to the needs of creation and the will of those wise enough to understand its ways.</p>
<p>As a god of air, Leviathan teaches that the winds are symbols of transformation, urging those who would learn from him to flow with the currents of life rather than exhaust themselves in futile resistance. Change is the only constant in existence, his priests proclaim, and those who embrace this truth find themselves carried to heights they never imagined possible.</p>
<p>The Guardian of Borea</p>
<p>Among Leviathan&#x27;&#x27;s sacred duties is his eternal guardianship over Borea, the frozen realm of perpetual winter where ancient spirits dwell and the boundary between worlds grows thin. Together with Tatsu, the Dragon God of Souls, Leviathan watches over this sacred land, ensuring that the balance of Aedelore remains undisturbed by those who would seek to corrupt it.</p>
<p>When Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen, descended upon Borea with dreams of conquest, it was Leviathan who rose to meet her alongside his fellow guardian. His torrents of wind cut through the shadows she wove, and his storms scattered the dark forms she summoned. Though the battle was fierce, the combined might of the dragon gods proved insurmountable, and the Shrouded Queen was driven back to contemplate her defeat.</p>
<p>This victory demonstrated the truth that Leviathan embodies-that the wind cannot be captured by shadows, that freedom cannot be chained by darkness, and that those who seek to impose their will upon the natural order will find the very air turning against them.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Adventure</p>
<p>Leviathan is the patron of all who seek adventure and exploration, of sailors who trust their sails to carry them to distant shores, of travelers who follow roads that lead beyond the edge of known maps. His blessing is sought by those who yearn to push boundaries and discover what lies beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>His temples are built on the highest peaks and the most exposed cliffs, places where the wind never ceases its song and worshippers can feel closest to their god. His priests are wanderers by nature, never staying in one place for long, carrying the teachings of the Wind Lord to every corner of Aedelore.</p>
<p>For those who seek his favor, Leviathan asks only this: embrace the freedom that is your birthright, flow with the winds of change rather than fight them, and never allow fear to clip the wings of your spirit. In return, the Lord of Storms offers the greatest gift of all-the wind at your back and endless skies before you.</p>

<h3>Tanin&#x27;iver</h3>
<p>This account was first spoken beside still waters at the dawn of the healing arts, when the first priests learned to channel the restorative power of the Serene One. It has been recited in temples of healing throughout the ages, whispered over the beds of the sick, and sung in celebration when the afflicted are restored to wholeness.</p>
<p>- Preserved in the Pools of Reflection by the Healers of the Cerulean Order, who tend the sacred springs that never run dry</p>
<p>Domain: Water, Serenity, Healing, and Renewal
Symbol: A tranquil wave, often depicted as a blue crescent moon reflected on the surface of a perfectly calm lake</p>
<p>The Sacred Mythos</p>
<p>Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver, the Serene God of Water, is revered as a majestic dragon of unparalleled grace, embodying the tranquil yet powerful essence of the element that gives life to all things. Born from the primordial waters that enveloped creation in its earliest moments-those vast depths that existed before land rose to divide them-he represents serenity, renewal, and the healing that flows as naturally as rivers to the sea.</p>
<p>In the ancient myths cherished by healers and those who dwell beside the waters, Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver is depicted as a magnificent dragon whose scales shimmer like the surface of a lake at dawn, catching and reflecting light in patterns of impossible beauty. His eyes hold the depth of oceans and the clarity of mountain springs, seeing not just what is but what can be restored to wholeness.</p>
<p>As the world was formed and shaped by divine hands, Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver soared across the emerging realms, guiding rivers to their destined courses, filling lakes with life-giving water, and creating the great seas that cradle Aedelore in their embrace. He nurtures all living beings, from the smallest fish that dart through shadowed pools to the mightiest trees whose roots drink deep from underground springs. Wherever his waters flow, life flourishes in abundance.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Water Lord</p>
<p>Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver is characterized in the sacred texts by his serene and gentle demeanor, embodying the most soothing qualities of water-its ability to cleanse, to cool, to heal, and to bring peace to the troubled spirit. He represents the eternal cycle of life and the vital importance of balance, teaching all who would listen that just as water can be both calm and tempestuous, so too does life present moments of peace and challenge in equal measure.</p>
<p>His presence is often evoked in times of great change and upheaval, for his soothing voice can calm the most violent storms of the heart, and his breath brings rain to lands parched by drought and despair. In times of crisis, Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver manifests as a protective force, using the power of water to heal what has been wounded and restore balance to what has been disrupted.</p>
<p>The Serene One teaches that water does not fight against obstacles but flows around them, finding its way through patience and persistence rather than force. This wisdom has guided countless souls through their darkest hours, reminding them that even the hardest stone is eventually shaped by the gentle persistence of flowing water.</p>
<p>The Gift of Healing</p>
<p>Among all the dragon gods, Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver is most closely associated with the healing arts. His temples serve as centers of restoration, where the sick and wounded are brought to be bathed in sacred waters that carry the blessing of the Serene One. Priests who devote themselves to his service spend years learning to channel the healing properties of water, becoming conduits for his restorative power.</p>
<p>It is said that Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver weeps for every creature that suffers, and his tears fall as the healing rains that restore vitality to the land. Those who pray to him in times of illness or injury often report dreams of swimming in waters of perfect clarity, emerging refreshed and renewed in both body and spirit.</p>
<p>The Cycle of Renewal</p>
<p>Above all, Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver represents the eternal truth that all things are renewed through the cycle of water-from rain to river to sea and back again to the clouds that carry life to distant lands. Nothing is ever truly lost, his priests teach, but only transformed and returned in new forms.</p>
<p>This teaching brings comfort to those who grieve, reminding them that the souls of the departed return to the great cycle just as water returns to the sea. It inspires those who have failed to try again, for just as the tide always returns to the shore, so too do opportunities come again to those who remain patient and faithful.</p>
<p>Those who seek the blessing of Tanin&#x27;&#x27;iver are taught to cultivate serenity in their own hearts, to become like still water that reflects the truth without distortion. In this clarity, they find the wisdom to heal not just bodies but spirits, not just individuals but communities, not just the present but the wounds of the past that still ripple through time.</p>
<p>For the Serene One asks only this of his followers: be as water-patient, persistent, and ever-flowing toward healing and renewal.</p>

<h3>Tatsu</h3>
<p>These words were transcribed from the dreams of the Deathwatchers, those mystics who sit beside the dying and record what is glimpsed in the threshold between worlds. Each phrase was spoken by souls in their final moments, when the veil grows thin and the presence of the Soul Guide is felt most keenly.</p>
<p>- Compiled in the Halls of Eternal Rest by Keeper Morthos, who has witnessed a thousand souls depart and knows the face of the Enigmatic One</p>
<p>Domain: Souls, Rebirth, Destiny, and the Afterlife
Symbol: A dragon entwined with a double helix of light and shadow, representing the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth that binds all existence</p>
<p>The Sacred Mythos</p>
<p>Tatsu, the Enigmatic Dragon God of Souls, is revered as a mysterious and profound deity who oversees the passage of souls between the realms of the living and the dead. Known for his shimmering scales that shift between ethereal colors-now silver as moonlight, now dark as the space between stars-Tatsu embodies the duality of existence itself: light and shadow, life and death, creation and dissolution.</p>
<p>In the creation myths of Aedelore, Tatsu is said to have emerged from the primordial void before form itself existed, where he wove the threads of fate and destiny into the great tapestry of existence. Every soul that has ever lived or will ever live was touched by his hands in the moment before birth, and every soul will meet him again when the mortal form falls away and the journey to the afterlife begins.</p>
<p>He is believed to guide souls on their passage after death, ensuring that each finds its rightful place in the realms beyond mortal sight. None are lost in the great crossing, for Tatsu sees all souls regardless of how they lived, and leads them with compassion to whatever awaits them in the eternal lands.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Soul Guide</p>
<p>Legends passed down through generations describe Tatsu as a figure of profound wisdom and deep compassion, yet also as an enigmatic force that holds secrets of the universe that mortal minds cannot fully comprehend. He traverses the veil between worlds as easily as others walk between rooms, appearing in dreams to offer guidance to those in need, to comfort the dying, and to remind the living that death is not an ending but a transformation.</p>
<p>He is often depicted as a majestic dragon with deep, knowing eyes that reflect the mysteries of life and death in their infinite depths. Those who have glimpsed him in dreams or visions speak of a presence that is both terrifying and comforting-terrifying because he represents the ultimate truth that all must face, comforting because he reveals that beyond that truth lies not oblivion but continuation.</p>
<p>Tatsu is characterized by his contemplative nature and his patience that spans eternities. He embodies the mysteries of existence, encouraging his followers to seek understanding of their own souls and the interconnectedness of all life. His presence brings calm to those who grapple with the complexities of mortality and destiny, reminding them that every ending is also a beginning.</p>
<p>The Guardian of Borea</p>
<p>Among his sacred duties, Tatsu serves as one of the eternal guardians of Borea, the frozen realm where the boundaries between worlds grow thin and ancient spirits dwell in the perpetual winter. Together with Leviathan, the Dragon God of Air, Tatsu watches over this sacred land where the living and the dead exist in closer proximity than anywhere else in Aedelore.</p>
<p>When Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen, sought to conquer Borea and bend it to her dark purposes, Tatsu rose to defend the sacred realm. His beams of soul energy cut through her shadows, revealing the truth hidden beneath her illusions. The battle that followed demonstrated that even the mistress of darkness could not deceive one who sees the truth of all souls.</p>
<p>The Teaching of the Soul Guide</p>
<p>As a deity of souls, Tatsu teaches that life is a journey of discovery and transformation, not a destination to be reached but a path to be walked with awareness and intention. He encourages his followers to explore the depths of their own being, to embrace both light and shadow within themselves, and to understand the impact of their choices on the world around them.</p>
<p>His priests serve as guides for the dying, sitting beside those whose time approaches and helping them prepare for the great crossing. They teach that death should not be feared but understood, for Tatsu awaits all souls with the same compassion regardless of how they lived. What matters is not avoiding the inevitable, but living in such a way that the soul grows and learns and becomes more fully itself.</p>
<p>The temples of Tatsu are places of contemplation and acceptance, where the grieving come to make peace with loss and the dying come to prepare for the journey ahead. In these sacred spaces, the veil between worlds is thin, and the presence of the Enigmatic One can be felt by all who open themselves to his wisdom.</p>
<p>For Tatsu teaches the greatest of all truths: that the soul is eternal, that death is merely a doorway, and that every ending in the great cycle of existence leads inevitably to a new beginning.</p>

<h3>Tiamat</h3>
<p>This account was first carved into living stone in the deepest caverns of the world, where the heartbeat of the earth itself can be heard by those who listen. The words have been renewed by each generation of Stone Speakers, who maintain the sacred connection between the surface peoples and the Steadfast One who dwells in the foundations of all things.</p>
<p>- Transcribed from the Cavern of First Stone by Earth Speaker Grundar, who walked the deepest paths and returned with the blessing of the Mountain Mother</p>
<p>Domain: Earth, Stability, Fertility, and Strength
Symbol: A majestic dragon encircled by a ring of mountains, representing the unyielding and nurturing nature of the earth that sustains all life</p>
<p>The Sacred Mythos</p>
<p>Tiamat, the Steadfast Dragon God of Earth, is revered as a colossal and ancient dragon whose very presence embodies the essence of the land itself. Emerging from the primordial depths when the world was still molten and forming, Tiamat is often depicted as a magnificent dragon adorned with scales resembling the textures of soil, rock, and growing things-representing the sacred union of earth and all its bountiful resources.</p>
<p>In the myths of Aedelore, Tiamat is said to have shaped the world with her powerful claws, creating the mountains that touch the sky, the valleys that cradle rivers, and the fertile plains that feed all who dwell upon the land. Her work was patient and deliberate, for the earth cannot be rushed, and true stability must be built foundation upon foundation across countless ages.</p>
<p>Legends tell of her nurturing the earth with her breath, imbuing it with life-giving energy that flows through stone and soil to sustain all living things. Tiamat&#x27;&#x27;s roar resonates through the mountains still, stirring the earth and calling forth the primal forces of nature that remind all who walk the land of the power that sleeps beneath their feet.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Earth Mother</p>
<p>Tiamat is portrayed in the sacred texts as a protector and nurturer above all else, embodying the stability and resilience of the earth that endures when all else changes. She is seen as the guardian of all living things, fostering growth and ensuring the balance of nature that allows each creature to find its place in the great web of existence.</p>
<p>Her essence is woven into the very fabric of the land, present in every stone and grain of soil, reminding all who dwell upon the earth of the importance of harmony with nature. Those who honor her learn that the land provides for all needs when treated with respect, and that the earth&#x27;&#x27;s patience should not be mistaken for weakness.</p>
<p>Unlike the tempestuous gods of the sky or the unpredictable deities of the void, Tiamat embodies stability, patience, and the enduring strength that outlasts all storms. Her essence is both calming and powerful, encouraging her followers to cultivate their inner strength while respecting the natural world around them. She teaches that true power is not found in swift destruction but in the patient building of foundations that will endure for ages.</p>
<p>The Gift of Fertility</p>
<p>Among Tiamat&#x27;&#x27;s greatest gifts to the peoples of Aedelore is the fertility of the land-the ability of the soil to bring forth crops, the minerals hidden in the mountains, the precious stones that form in darkness over countless years. Farmers pray to her for bountiful harvests, miners seek her blessing before descending into the earth, and builders invoke her name when laying the foundations of structures meant to stand for generations.</p>
<p>Her temples are built from the finest stone, often located in places where the earth&#x27;&#x27;s power is most apparent-beside volcanoes, in the hearts of mountains, or in fertile valleys where the soil is rich and dark. Her priests learn the language of stone and growing things, serving as intermediaries between the peoples of the surface and the ancient forces that dwell below.</p>
<p>The Teaching of the Steadfast One</p>
<p>As a deity of earth, Tiamat teaches that true strength comes from resilience and unity with nature rather than from force or domination. The mountain does not fight the wind; it simply endures until the wind has passed. The earth does not struggle against the changing seasons; it embraces each in turn and brings forth life appropriate to every time.</p>
<p>Her followers learn that patience is not passivity but the deepest form of strength, that roots must grow deep before the tree can grow tall, and that the strongest structures are those built slowly with care rather than raised hastily in ambition. They are taught to respect the land, to take only what is needed, and to return to the earth what is owed.</p>
<p>Tiamat&#x27;&#x27;s presence inspires all who seek stability in chaotic times, reminding them that beneath the tumult of surface events, the deep foundations of the world remain unchanged. In her steadfast nature, her followers find the courage to endure hardship, the patience to wait for better times, and the strength to build things that will outlast their own brief lives.</p>
<p>For the Steadfast One teaches this truth above all others: the earth endures, and those who root themselves in her wisdom will endure as well.</p>

<h3>Tohu</h3>
<p>These revelations were received in the Tower of Infinite Stairs, where the Arcane Creed maintains their eternal vigil over the Living Weave. Each word was verified against the patterns of magic itself, for the Mysterious One speaks in riddles and his truths must be discerned by those with eyes to see beyond the surface of things.</p>
<p>- Recorded by Archweaver Lyranthos during the Night of Seven Moons, when the barriers between understanding and mystery grew thin</p>
<p>Domain: Magic, Mysticism, Knowledge, and Transformation
Symbol: An intricate spiral of stars and arcane symbols, representing the boundless possibilities and hidden knowledge of the magical realms</p>
<p>The Sacred Mythos</p>
<p>Tohu, the Mysterious Dragon God of Magic, is revered throughout Aedelore as the architect of arcane wonders and the keeper of ancient secrets that predate the world itself. With scales that shimmer like starlight caught in crystal and eyes that reflect the infinite cosmos, Tohu embodies the enigmatic nature of magic itself-that force which underlies all existence yet can never be fully understood or contained.</p>
<p>Legends preserved by the Arcane Creed tell of his emergence from the ether at the very dawn of creation, when the first patterns of existence were being woven into the fabric of reality. In that primordial moment, Tohu breathed life into the mystical energies that permeate the universe, creating what the wise call the Living Weave-the great tapestry of magic that connects all things and makes transformation possible.</p>
<p>Tohu is believed to have gifted the world with magic itself, weaving it into the very fabric of reality so thoroughly that it can never be fully separated from existence. As a deity of transformation, he inspires all who study the arcane arts to explore the depths of their potential and unlock the hidden powers that slumber within every conscious being.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Magic Weaver</p>
<p>Tohu is depicted in the ancient texts as a majestic dragon coiling through the cosmos, leaving trails of sparkling stardust in his wake that become the constellations by which mortals navigate and prophets read the future. His form is ever-shifting, never quite the same from one moment to the next, for he embodies the truth that magic is transformation and nothing touched by magic remains unchanged.</p>
<p>He is characterized by his profound wisdom and an air of playful mystery that has confounded scholars for ages. He embodies the duality of magic-its ability to create and destroy, to illuminate the seeker and confound the fool, to grant power to those who understand and humble those who think themselves masters. Followers of Tohu find him to be both mentor and trickster, guiding them through the labyrinthine paths of knowledge while challenging their perceptions at every turn.</p>
<p>As a deity of magic, Tohu encourages exploration and experimentation, believing that true mastery comes from curiosity and innovation rather than rigid adherence to established forms. He is a patron of scholars and wizards, of seekers of truth and dreamers of impossible dreams, inspiring all who dare to delve into the arcane mysteries that shape their world.</p>
<p>The Living Weave</p>
<p>Central to Tohu&#x27;&#x27;s legacy is the Living Weave-the great tapestry of magical energy that he wove into existence at the dawn of time. This Weave connects all things, flows through all living beings, and makes possible every spell cast and every wonder worked throughout Aedelore. It is said that those who learn to perceive the Weave can see the underlying patterns of reality itself, the threads of cause and effect that bind past to future.</p>
<p>Auren Vale, the first mortal to pierce the Veil and perceive the Weave after ages of magical silence, received his gift ultimately from Tohu, whether he knew it or not. The Arcane Creed he founded maintains devotion to the Mysterious One, understanding that all who work magic do so through his grace and within the patterns he established.</p>
<p>The Creator of Guardians</p>
<p>Among Tohu&#x27;&#x27;s lesser-known works is the creation of the Groove Guardian, the Wild Spirit who watches over nature in Aedelore. When the world was young and chaos threatened to overwhelm the delicate balance of life, Tohu gazed upon the suffering of the natural world and determined that a guardian was needed. From his own magical essence combined with the pure spirit of nature itself, he brought forth the Groove Guardian to serve as protector and nurturer of the wild places.</p>
<p>The Teaching of the Mysterious One</p>
<p>Tohu teaches that magic is not a tool to be wielded but a mystery to be embraced, not a force to be conquered but a relationship to be cultivated. Those who approach the arcane arts with humility and wonder find doors opening before them; those who approach with arrogance and greed find only frustration and danger.</p>
<p>His temples are towers of learning where the greatest magical minds gather to study, debate, and push the boundaries of what is known. His priests are scholars and experimenters, ever seeking new understanding while respecting the dangers inherent in powers they can never fully control.</p>
<p>For Tohu teaches this truth to all who would learn: the universe is far stranger and more wonderful than any mortal mind can fully comprehend, and the greatest wisdom is knowing that there will always be more to discover. In this eternal mystery lies not frustration but joy, for the journey of understanding has no end, and every answer reveals new questions waiting to be asked.</p>

<h3>The Groove Guardian: The Wild Spirit</h3>
<p>This account was whispered by the trees themselves to those druids who have learned the slow speech of growing things. It tells of the Wild Spirit who runs through the forests of Aedelore, protecting all that grows and hunts and lives beneath the green canopy. Let those who read these words remember that the wild places have their guardian, and that guardian sees all who enter his domain.</p>
<p>- Transcribed in the Grove of First Speaking by Archdruid Fernweather, who spent forty years learning to hear what the forest wished to tell</p>
<p>Name: The Groove Guardian
Titles: The Wild Spirit, The Keeper of the Hunt
Appearance: A majestic creature blending the forms of wolf and fox, with sleek fur of shifting colors, bright amber eyes that see through all deception, and an ethereal, shimmering presence that seems to blend with the natural world around it</p>
<p>Origins and Awakening</p>
<p>In the ancient days before the birth of Aedelore as mortals know it, when the world was still a canvas of chaos filled with untamed magic and unrestrained potential, the primordial forces clashed in conflicts that shook the foundations of existence. Nature itself suffered in these battles, and the delicate balance of life teetered on the brink of annihilation as powers beyond comprehension warred for supremacy.</p>
<p>It was during this tumultuous era that Tohu, the Mysterious Dragon God of Magic, gazed upon the chaos and felt a profound sense of sorrow for the land and all its creatures. He saw forests burning, rivers running dry, and living things caught between forces that cared nothing for their survival. His heart, though divine, was moved by the suffering of the natural world.</p>
<p>Tohu understood that a guardian was needed to nurture and protect the wild places-one who could embody the spirit of nature itself and maintain harmony among all living things. In a moment of divine inspiration that would reshape the world, Tohu infused a section of pristine wilderness with pure magic, weaving the very essence of nature into its fabric until land and magic became one.</p>
<p>This infusion sparked life within the heart of the ancient forest, causing a magnificent transformation that the trees still sing of in their slow, patient way. From the depths of this magical grove, the Groove Guardian emerged-born from the harmonious convergence of Tohu&#x27;&#x27;s magic and the untamed essence of nature itself.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Wild Spirit</p>
<p>The Guardian manifested as a magnificent creature unlike any other in Aedelore-part wolf, part fox, embodying both cunning and strength, both the hunter and the hunted, both the fierce predator and the clever survivor. With each step upon the forest floor, the Guardian brought vitality to the land, awakening flora and fauna that had slumbered in fear, and restoring the balance that had been so long disrupted by the wars of greater powers.</p>
<p>The Guardian soon established a realm of protection and nurturing known as the Verdant Heart, where the magic of Tohu flows freely through every leaf and root. This sanctuary became a sacred space for all creatures, a refuge where harmony prevails and the circle of life thrives as it was meant to from the beginning. Here, predator and prey exist in balance, and the great cycle of nature turns without the interference of those who would disrupt it.</p>
<p>As the Wild Spirit, the Groove Guardian took upon itself the eternal duty of watching over Aedelore&#x27;&#x27;s wild places, ensuring that the lessons of survival, respect, and interdependence are maintained wherever green things grow and wild things run.</p>
<p>The Character of the Guardian</p>
<p>The Groove Guardian is a being of profound wisdom and fierce independence, embodying the very essence of the wild in all its aspects. Its personality reflects the duality of nature itself-gentle yet fierce, nurturing yet relentless, playful yet deadly serious when its domain is threatened.</p>
<p>The Guardian possesses a sharp intellect, capable of navigating the complexities of nature and understanding the intricate web of life that connects all living things. It is a master strategist in the eternal hunt, employing cunning tactics to protect its realm and guide its followers to understand that nature rewards the clever as much as the strong.</p>
<p>Yet with a spirit as lively as the forest itself, the Guardian also delights in playful interactions with the creatures under its protection. It can often be glimpsed darting through the underbrush, playfully teasing animals or leading those who seek it on merry chases through sun-dappled glades. This playful nature serves to remind all who witness it of the joy and wonder found in the natural world.</p>
<p>When its domain is threatened, however, the Guardian transforms into a formidable protector whose fierce loyalty to the natural world fuels a burning determination to defend it against any encroachment. Those who would harm the balance of nature-poachers, despoilers, those who take more than they need-soon learn that the Groove Guardian is not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>The Teaching of the Wild Spirit</p>
<p>The Guardian possesses ancient knowledge passed down from the moment of its creation, holding wisdom that predates the civilizations of elves and dwarves. It acts as mentor to those who seek to understand the ways of the wild, imparting lessons about respect for all life, the importance of balance, and the truth that every creature has its place in the great web of existence.</p>
<p>Those who would learn from the Groove Guardian must first prove their worthiness by demonstrating respect for the wild places and understanding that they are guests in a realm older and greater than any kingdom built by mortal hands. The Guardian reveals itself only to those it deems worthy, and its presence is felt rather than seen-a rustle in the underbrush, a flicker of amber eyes in the shadows, a whisper carried on the wind.</p>
<p>Its followers are taught to take only what they need, to honor the spirits of creatures they hunt, and to understand that they are part of nature, not masters of it. In return, the wild places provide all that is necessary for life, and the Guardian&#x27;&#x27;s blessing ensures safe passage through forests that would otherwise prove deadly to the unprepared.</p>
<p>For the Groove Guardian teaches this truth to all who enter the wild: nature is not a resource to be exploited but a community to which all living things belong. Honor this truth, and the wild will embrace you. Forget it, and the Wild Spirit will remind you-one way or another.</p>

<h3>Zarathen: The Whisperer in the Void</h3>
<p>These words should not exist. They were pieced together from the ravings of madmen, the confessions of the damned, and the final whispers of those who gazed too long into the void. No single scribe possesses this knowledge in full, for to know Zarathen completely is to become his vessel. What follows is but a shadow of the truth-and even shadows of this darkness are dangerous beyond measure.</p>
<p>- Assembled in secret by the Conclave of the Sealed Gate, from fragments scattered across a thousand years of forbidden texts, and preserved only so that others might recognize the signs of his influence before it is too late</p>
<p>Titles: The Whisperer in the Void, The Patient Darkness, The Corruptor of Kings, He Who Waits Between
Domain: Corruption, Forbidden Knowledge, The Spaces Between Worlds, Temptation
Symbol: None dare depict him, but his presence is marked by spiraling patterns that seem to move when viewed from the corner of one&#x27;&#x27;s eye</p>
<p>The Nature of the Whisperer</p>
<p>Before the Dragon Gods shaped the earth, before Zelgor clashed with Taninsam in the first great battle of light and shadow, before even the Black Sun released its gathered power to birth the cosmos-there existed the Void. And within that Void, in the spaces between what is and what might be, dwelt entities of such alien nature that even the gods themselves could not fully comprehend their existence.</p>
<p>Zarathen is one such entity-perhaps the most terrible of those that survived the birth of creation. He is not darkness as mortals understand it, for darkness is merely the absence of light. He is something far more fundamental: the corruption that exists within potential itself, the whisper that turns ambition into obsession, the patient hunger that transforms the noble into the damned.</p>
<p>Unlike Zelgor, who is chaos incarnate and seeks the destruction of all order, Zarathen does not desire annihilation. His hunger is more subtle, more insidious. He feeds upon the fall of the righteous, the corruption of the pure, the slow twisting of noble souls into instruments of darkness. Each king who becomes a tyrant, each priest who abandons their faith, each hero who succumbs to temptation-these are his sustenance, and he has fed well across the ages.</p>
<p>The Void Between Worlds</p>
<p>Zarathen dwells in the spaces that exist between dimensions-the cracks in reality through which no light passes and no sound escapes. He is bound there, not by chains or seals, but by the very nature of his being. He cannot fully manifest in the world of form, for his essence is antithetical to the structured existence that the Dragon Gods created.</p>
<p>Yet this binding is not a prison as mortals would understand it. From his realm between worlds, Zarathen can reach into the dreams and thoughts of those whose souls have begun to crack under the weight of ambition, despair, or desire for forbidden power. He whispers to them in the silence between heartbeats, offers them visions in the darkness behind their closed eyes, and plants seeds of corruption that may take centuries to bloom.</p>
<p>His patience is beyond mortal comprehension. Where other dark forces rage against their limitations, Zarathen waits. He has watched civilizations rise and fall, has seen empires crumble to dust, has witnessed the births and deaths of beings that thought themselves immortal. To him, a century is but a moment, and a mortal lifetime passes in what seems a single breath.</p>
<p>The Corruption of Malcath</p>
<p>Of all Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s works across the ages, none is more infamous than the corruption of Malcath, the Elven King of the city that now lies sunken beneath the Lake of Shadows. Here was a soul that seemed beyond reproach-a king beloved by his people, devoted to the goddess Tohu, wise in the ways of magic and governance. Yet within Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s heart, Zarathen sensed the crack that would become a chasm: an ambition that exceeded the bounds of mortality.</p>
<p>For years beyond counting, Zarathen whispered to Malcath in his moments of solitude. At first, the whispers were gentle-questions that seemed to arise from Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s own thoughts. Why should such a wise king be bound by mortality? Why should the gods alone possess the power of eternity? Was not Malcath, in his wisdom and devotion, worthy of ascending beyond the limitations of his elven form?</p>
<p>The whispers grew louder as Malcath began to listen, and listening, began to seek. Zarathen guided him to forbidden texts, revealed the locations of hidden knowledge, and finally manifested before him in the shadows of his secret study-a form of writhing darkness that spoke with a voice like silk wrapped around a blade.</p>
<p>The rituals Zarathen taught were not merely spells but transformations of the soul itself. Each dark rite bound Malcath more tightly to the Whisperer&#x27;&#x27;s influence, drew him further from the light of Tohu, and fed the hungry void with the essence of all that the king had once cherished. By the time Malcath stood upon his tower to complete the final ritual of ascension, the being that had been a beloved king was little more than a vessel for Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s will.</p>
<p>When Tohu intervened and cast Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s soul into the void, Zarathen claimed what remained-a twisted spirit bound eternally to the shadows, still dreaming of the godhood it was denied, still serving the Whisperer&#x27;&#x27;s purposes even in damnation.</p>
<p>The Signs of His Influence</p>
<p>Those who study the forbidden texts speak of signs that mark one who has begun to hear Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s whispers. The afflicted become secretive, withdrawing from those who love them to pursue solitary studies. They grow obsessed with questions of power and immortality, dismissing the concerns of others as the fears of lesser minds. They begin to see visions in shadows and hear voices in silence-and they come to believe these visions and voices are their own thoughts, their own insights, their own discoveries.</p>
<p>Most telling is the gradual erosion of compassion. Those touched by Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s influence come to view other beings as tools or obstacles, never as equals. They justify cruelties as necessary steps toward their great purpose. They sacrifice what they once treasured, always believing that the final goal will justify any cost.</p>
<p>By the time they realize the truth-if they ever do-they have wandered too far down the path to turn back. Their souls are cracked beyond mending, and Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s patience has been rewarded with another servant bound to the darkness between worlds.</p>
<p>The Eternal Hunger</p>
<p>What does Zarathen seek? The sages who dare to contemplate this question offer no certain answers, for his nature defies mortal understanding. Some believe he wishes to break free of the void entirely, to manifest fully in the world of form and remake it in his own image. Others suggest that he has no goal beyond the corruption itself-that the fall of noble souls is not a means to an end but the end itself, the only pleasure his alien nature can experience.</p>
<p>The most disturbing theory holds that Zarathen is not a single entity but an aspect of something far greater-a tendril of the primordial void itself, given just enough consciousness to serve as a vector of corruption. In this view, every soul he claims weakens the fabric of creation, bringing the cosmos one step closer to returning to the formless nothing from which it emerged.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth, the wise know this: Zarathen cannot be fought with swords or spells, for he exists beyond the reach of such things. He can only be resisted through vigilance, humility, and the recognition that the whispers promising power and transcendence come not from within but from the hungry darkness between worlds.</p>
<p>The Warning of the Sealed Gate</p>
<p>Let all who read these words take heed: Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s influence did not end with Malcath&#x27;&#x27;s fall. The Sunken City lies beneath the Lake of Shadows, and within it, the echoes of Zarathen&#x27;&#x27;s corruption still linger. The blood spilled in war feeds the darkness there, weakens the seals that bind the remnants of his work, and calls to him across the void.</p>
<p>He is patient. He is eternal. And he is always listening for the next soul whose ambition outstrips their wisdom, whose desire for power creates the crack through which his whispers can enter.</p>
<p>The Conclave of the Sealed Gate maintains eternal vigilance against his influence, but they know that they cannot prevent all from falling to his temptations. They can only preserve this knowledge, pass it to those who come after, and hope that the warning reaches those who need it before the whispers begin.</p>
<p>For in the end, the only true defense against Zarathen is to know that he exists-and to remember, in the moments when ambition burns brightest and the path to power seems clearest, that the Whisperer in the Void is always waiting in the shadows between thoughts, patient as eternity itself.</p>

<h2>Mysteries of Aedelore</h2>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Doctrine of Emanations</h3>
<p>What follows is forbidden not because it is false, but because it is true. The uninitiated mind, confronted with the naked structure of reality, may shatter like glass before a storm. Read only if you are prepared to see the world as it truly is - a cascade of light descending from darkness, a dream dreaming itself into form.</p>
<p>- Inscribed upon the inner walls of the Temple of the Black Sun, visible only to those who have passed the Third Veil</p>
<p>I. Know that all things flow from the One, and the One is the Black Sun - that which gathers and releases, that which creates through destruction and destroys through creation.</p>
<p>II. Before the Black Sun breathed forth the Dragon Aspects, it contained all possibility within itself. It was the unmanifest - pure potential, pregnant with every world that could ever be.</p>
<p>III. When it released its gathered light, that light did not scatter randomly. It fell in layers, each layer a veil between what is above and what is below.</p>
<p>IV. The first emanation was Fire - raw creative force, the will to exist. This became Taninsam, who carries within him the original impulse of creation.</p>
<p>V. The second emanation was Water - reflection, healing, the capacity to receive and transform. This became Tanin&#x27;iver, who mirrors the light so that it may know itself.</p>
<p>VI. The third emanation was Air - movement, change, the breath that carries life from one form to another. This became Leviathan, who ensures that nothing remains stagnant.</p>
<p>VII. The fourth emanation was Earth - stability, patience, the foundation upon which all else is built. This became Tiamat, who holds the pattern steady while others dance.</p>
<p>VIII. The fifth emanation was Spirit - consciousness itself, the spark that separates the living from the merely existing. This became Tatsu, shepherd of all souls.</p>
<p>IX. The sixth emanation was Magic - the hidden threads that connect all things, the language by which reality speaks to itself. This became Tohu, weaver of the arcane.</p>
<p>X. Know that these six are not separate beings but aspects of one light, refracted through the prism of existence. To understand one is to glimpse all; to know all is to return to the source.</p>
<p>XI. Below the gods lies the world - Aedelore, the Land of Divine Light. It is the furthest emanation from the source, the densest crystallization of the original fire.</p>
<p>XII. Yet know this mystery: that which is furthest from the source is also closest to return. The light that descends must eventually ascend. What falls, rises.</p>
<p>XIII. The mortal races dwell at the bottom of the great cascade, seeing only shadows of the divine fire. Yet within each mortal burns a spark of that original light - the soul.</p>
<p>XIV. This spark is not given by the gods; it IS the gods, fragmented into countless vessels. When you look upon another soul, you look upon the face of the Divine, veiled in flesh.</p>
<p>XV. Know that the purpose of existence is the return - the gathering of scattered light back to its source. Every act of wisdom, every moment of love, every flash of true understanding is a step upon this path.</p>
<p>XVI. As above, so below. As below, so above. The structure of the cosmos is mirrored in the structure of the soul. He who knows himself knows the universe.</p>
<p>XVII. This is the Doctrine of Emanations, the first teaching of the inner mysteries. Let those who have ears hear, and those who have eyes see.</p>

</div>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Mystery of the Void</h3>
<p>There are those who believe the Void is emptiness - the absence of all things. They are wrong. The Void is fullness beyond measure, potential so vast that it appears as nothing to eyes trained only to see what already exists. What follows will disturb your understanding of existence itself. This is intentional.</p>
<p>- From the Black Codex, a text that exists in only one copy, chained in the deepest vault of the Rivermount Library</p>
<p>I. Before the Black Sun, there was the Void. Know that this is not a statement of time, for time itself is a creation. The Void simply IS - eternal, boundless, the womb from which all things emerge and to which all things return.</p>
<p>II. The Void is not darkness, for darkness is merely the absence of light. The Void is that which contains both light and darkness, and the space between them, and the possibility of spaces not yet conceived.</p>
<p>III. Within the Void, the Black Sun coalesced - not from nothing, but from everything. It gathered potential into itself until that potential demanded release. This is the nature of creation: pressure seeking expression.</p>
<p>IV. Know that the Void did not end when creation began. It surrounds all worlds still, pressing against the boundaries of existence like an ocean against a ship&#x27;s hull.</p>
<p>V. There are places where the boundary grows thin. The spaces between stars. The depths beneath the deepest waters. The moment between sleeping and waking. In these liminal zones, the Void whispers to those who listen.</p>
<p>VI. What does it whisper? It speaks of possibilities - worlds that could be, paths not taken, selves not yet born. Some who hear these whispers are driven mad. Others are transformed.</p>
<p>VII. Know that the Void is neither good nor evil. It is beyond such distinctions, as the ocean is beyond the concerns of the fish within it. It simply exists, vast and patient and full of terrible potential.</p>
<p>VIII. Yet there are things that dwell within the Void - beings that existed before the Black Sun&#x27;s first breath, entities that have never known the limitations of form.</p>
<p>IX. These beings have many names in many tongues. Some call them the Outer Ones. Others name them the Dwellers in Darkness. The Halflings, in their ancient wisdom, call them simply the Hungry.</p>
<p>X. Know that the Hungry do not hate the created worlds. Hatred requires understanding, and they do not understand existence as we know it. They are simply drawn to the light as moths are drawn to flame.</p>
<p>XI. The barriers between the Void and the world are maintained by many forces - the dreaming of gods, the turning of stars, the ancient words spoken by those who remember. When these barriers weaken, the Hungry press closer.</p>
<p>XII. This is why blood magic is forbidden. This is why certain names must never be spoken. This is why the seals beneath the Lake of Shadows were placed with such desperate care.</p>
<p>XIII. Know that what sleeps beneath that lake is not a creature of Aedelore. It is something that slipped through when the barriers were young and weak - something that has waited, dreaming its alien dreams, for ages beyond counting.</p>
<p>XIV. The Void remembers all possibilities, including those that should never manifest. In its depths lie the blueprints for horrors beyond imagination - and the patterns for beauties beyond description.</p>
<p>XV. This is the final teaching of the Void: that creation and destruction are merely different expressions of the same infinite potential. What can be made can be unmade. What has been unmade can be remade.</p>
<p>XVI. Let the wise treat the Void with respect, neither fleeing from its contemplation nor seeking to pierce its veils unbidden. It is the source and the destination, the question and the answer, the darkness that gives meaning to light.</p>

<h3>The Nature of Souls</h3>
<p>You believe you have a soul. This is imprecise. You do not have a soul - you ARE a soul. You have a body. This distinction, seemingly small, changes everything. What follows is the teaching of Tatsu, Shepherd of Souls, as revealed to those who have walked beyond death and returned.</p>
<p>- Recorded by the Order of the Final Threshold, whose members have each died and been restored, and who speak with authority of what lies beyond</p>
<p>I. In the beginning, when the Black Sun breathed forth the Dragon Aspects, one portion of that divine light was given the task of consciousness itself. This was Tatsu, and his gift was the most precious of all.</p>
<p>II. Know that without Tatsu&#x27;s breath, the world would exist but would not know that it exists. Trees would grow but would not reach toward the sun. Waters would flow but would not sing. There would be being, but no awareness of being.</p>
<p>III. The soul is a fragment of divine consciousness wrapped in flesh. It is not created when a body is born; it exists eternally, taking form after form in the great wheel of existence.</p>
<p>IV. Know that this wheel turns not as punishment, but as education. Each life is a lesson; each death, a graduation. The soul accumulates wisdom across countless incarnations, slowly remembering what it always knew.</p>
<p>V. What does it seek to remember? Its own divine nature. The soul is a spark of the Black Sun that has forgotten it is fire. The purpose of existence is this remembering.</p>
<p>VI. When the body dies, the soul does not perish. It cannot perish, for it is made of that which has no beginning and no end. It merely sheds one garment and, in time, dons another.</p>
<p>VII. Between lives, the soul rests in Tatsu&#x27;s realm - a place beyond description, where time flows differently and the weight of flesh is forgotten. Here it reviews what it has learned and chooses what it will learn next.</p>
<p>VIII. Know that the choice of incarnation is not random. The soul selects the life that will teach it what it most needs to know. The beggar chose poverty to learn humility. The king chose power to learn its limits.</p>
<p>IX. This is why judgment is folly. You do not know what lesson another soul is learning, what karma it is balancing, what ancient pattern it is completing. Compassion, not judgment, is the response of wisdom.</p>
<p>X. The Elves, being closest to the divine source, remember more between lives than other races. This is the secret of their apparent immortality - their souls do not fully forget.</p>
<p>XI. Yet this gift is also a burden. Know that the Elves who became Human did so because remembering had become too painful. They chose forgetting as a mercy, trading eternal memory for the peace of not knowing.</p>
<p>XII. Humans live brief lives but learn quickly, precisely because they have forgotten. Each discovery is fresh; each joy, uncompared. In their ignorance is a kind of freedom the Elves can never know.</p>
<p>XIII. The Dwarves&#x27; souls are bound more tightly to the earth, cycling through lives rooted in stone and craft. They remember their ancestors because their souls are closely woven with those who came before.</p>
<p>XIV. The Halflings stand apart. Their souls are not individual sparks but tendrils of a greater root - connected to each other and to the land itself in ways other races cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>XV. Know that there are souls older than the mortal races - beings that chose never to incarnate in flesh, who watch the wheel turn from outside its motion. Some call them spirits; others, angels; others still, the Watchers.</p>
<p>XVI. And there are souls that have turned away from the light entirely - not destroyed, for souls cannot be destroyed, but twisted into something that feeds on others rather than growing by its own effort. These are the true undead.</p>
<p>XVII. The final mystery of souls is this: all souls are one soul, dreaming itself into multiplicity. When you harm another, you harm yourself. When you love another, you love yourself. Separation is the illusion; unity is the truth.</p>
<p>XVIII. Let those who understand this teaching act accordingly. The path to the Divine lies not in escaping the world, but in recognizing the Divine within every face you meet.</p>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Hidden Names</h3>
<p>All things have names. Most have many - the name given by parents, the name spoken by friends, the name whispered by enemies. But beneath all these lies the True Name, the sound that IS the thing itself. He who knows a True Name holds power that kings would envy and gods would fear.</p>
<p>- From the Fragments of Aelindor, scattered across seven libraries, never to be gathered in one place lest their combined knowledge prove too dangerous</p>
<p>I. In the moment before creation, when the Black Sun prepared to release its gathered light, it spoke. That speaking was the first act of creation, for the Word preceded the World.</p>
<p>II. Know that this original Word contained within it all words that would ever be spoken. Every name, every song, every cry of pain or joy - all were present in that first utterance, waiting to unfold.</p>
<p>III. When Tohu wove magic into the fabric of existence, she did so through naming. She spoke the True Names of stone and water, of fire and wind, and in the speaking, gave them power to respond to those who knew the names.</p>
<p>IV. This is the deepest secret of magic: it is not force imposed upon the world, but conversation with it. The mage who knows the True Name of fire does not command fire - he asks, and fire, recognizing its own name, responds.</p>
<p>V. Know that True Names cannot be invented or assigned. They can only be discovered. They exist as surely as the things they name, woven into the fabric of reality itself.</p>
<p>VI. The Elves were the first mortals to recover fragments of the naming tongue. Their high magic is built upon this foundation - words of power passed down through generations, jealously guarded.</p>
<p>VII. Yet even the Elves know only fragments. The complete True Name of fire would grant absolute dominion over all flame that has ever burned or ever will burn. Such power is not meant for mortal minds.</p>
<p>VIII. The Halflings know names older than the Elves have dreamed of - names of earth and root, of seed and season. These they do not speak but sing, for their names are melodies rather than words.</p>
<p>IX. Know that every being also has a True Name - including you. Your True Name is the sound of your soul, the vibration that distinguishes you from all other sparks of consciousness in the cosmos.</p>
<p>X. To know another&#x27;s True Name is to know them utterly - their fears and hopes, their strengths and weaknesses, the shape of their destiny. This is why True Names are guarded more closely than any treasure.</p>
<p>XI. There are beings who hunt for True Names - collectors of power who seek dominion over others. Some are mortal mages drunk on ambition. Others are entities far older and far more patient.</p>
<p>XII. Know that the thing beneath the Lake of Shadows once knew many True Names. In the age before its imprisonment, it whispered names in the ears of the ambitious, and those who heard found themselves unable to refuse its gifts - or its demands.</p>
<p>XIII. The seals that bind it are themselves Names - words of unbinding spoken in reverse, creating silence where there was sound. This is why the Halflings guard them: they know the counter-names, the sounds of forgetting.</p>
<p>XIV. There are Names that must never be spoken. The True Name of Death, if uttered, would unravel the boundary between living and dead. The True Name of the Void would open a door that could never be closed.</p>
<p>XV. Yet there are also Names of healing, of protection, of light. The priests who heal with a word are speaking fragments of these Names, channeling power through sounds they do not fully understand.</p>
<p>XVI. Know that your own True Name is hidden from you for your protection. To know it fully would be to see yourself as the Divine sees you - and few mortal minds can bear such clarity.</p>
<p>XVII. The path to power through Names is long and treacherous. Many who walk it are consumed by what they learn. But for those who persist with wisdom and humility, the universe itself becomes a conversation partner.</p>
<p>XVIII. Let the seeker be warned: Names have power, and power has consequences. Speak carefully. Listen more than you speak. And never, ever answer when something in the darkness calls you by a name you do not recognize.</p>

<div class="page-content">
<h3>The Dreaming of Gods</h3>
<p>We speak of gods as if they were distant, enthroned in heavens beyond our reach. This is comforting, for it absolves us of proximity to the terrible. But know that Taninsam and Tohu sleep beneath the mountains of Thorsheim, close enough that their dreams ripple through reality. When gods dream, worlds tremble.</p>
<p>- Whispered among the Seers of the Obsidian Circle, who watch the patterns of divine slumber and warn of the stirrings within</p>
<p>I. When Taninsam and Tohu chose to remain in Aedelore while their siblings departed for distant creations, they faced a dilemma. Divine consciousness, fully awake, warps reality around it. They could not walk among their creation without changing it by their very presence.</p>
<p>II. Know that this is why they chose to sleep. Not from weariness - gods do not tire - but from love. Their waking would have overwhelmed the delicate patterns they had woven. In sleep, they could remain close without destroying what they cherished.</p>
<p>III. Yet the sleep of gods is not the sleep of mortals. When you sleep, your consciousness withdraws from the world. When a god sleeps, their consciousness expands, becoming diffuse, touching everything without grasping anything.</p>
<p>IV. Taninsam&#x27;s dreams are fire and passion. When he dreams of joy, the summers are warm and the harvests abundant. When he dreams of rage, volcanoes wake and wildfires race across the land.</p>
<p>V. Know that the great eruption of Mount Cinder, three centuries past, was not natural catastrophe. Taninsam dreamed of the First War, and his sleeping anger found expression through stone and flame.</p>
<p>VI. Tohu&#x27;s dreams are subtler but no less powerful. She dreams in patterns and possibilities, in connections and transformations. When her dreams shift, the currents of magic shift with them.</p>
<p>VII. There are mages who have learned to read these shifts - to sense when Tohu&#x27;s dreaming mind turns toward certain types of magic, making them easier to work. They call themselves the Dream-Readers.</p>
<p>VIII. Know that the gods dream of mortals as mortals dream of gods. In their vast sleeping minds, the lives of races flicker like candle flames - brief, beautiful, endlessly fascinating.</p>
<p>IX. Sometimes a mortal catches the attention of a dreaming god. This is both blessing and curse. To be dreamed by Taninsam is to burn with purpose, to feel passions that threaten to consume. To be dreamed by Tohu is to see patterns others cannot, to know things that perhaps should remain unknown.</p>
<p>X. The gods can be woken. This has happened twice in recorded history - once during the First War, when Taninsam rose in wrath, and once more, it is whispered, during an event so terrible that its memory was deliberately erased from all records.</p>
<p>XI. Know that waking a god is not like waking a mortal. There is no gentle transition. Divine consciousness, compressed from its dream-state, snaps into focused awareness with force enough to shatter mountains.</p>
<p>XII. Those near a god&#x27;s waking often do not survive. The priests who called Taninsam forth during the First War were consumed in the first instant of his awakening - not from malice, but from the sheer impossibility of mortal flesh enduring such proximity to the divine.</p>
<p>XIII. Yet there are those who seek to wake the gods deliberately. Some act from desperation, believing only divine intervention can save them. Others act from madness, seeking power they cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>XIV. Know that the dreaming of gods serves a purpose beyond mere rest. In their dreams, they maintain the fundamental patterns of reality. The rising of the sun, the turning of seasons, the flow of magic - all are held in place by divine dreaming.</p>
<p>XV. If both gods woke fully and remained awake, reality itself would begin to fray. The patterns would lose their anchor. This is why they take turns in the depths of sleep and the shallows of dreaming.</p>
<p>XVI. The Halflings, closest to the dreaming earth, sometimes catch glimpses of divine dreams. They speak of vast visions - of creation and destruction, of love and loss, of patterns too large for mortal minds to hold.</p>
<p>XVII. Let the wise approach the sleeping gods with reverence. Pray, but do not demand. Seek, but do not wake. The dreams of gods are not for mortals to interrupt, for in those dreams, we ourselves exist.</p>
<p>XVIII. And know this final truth: the gods dream of an ending. Not destruction, but completion - a time when the scattered light returns to its source and the great cycle begins anew. Whether this is prophecy or merely divine wondering, none can say.</p>

<h3>The Seven Veils</h3>
<p>You who read this stand upon a path, though you may not know it. Every soul walks toward the light or away from it, ascending through veils of illusion or descending into deeper forgetting. What follows is the map of that journey - the stages of awakening that the wise have charted across countless generations.</p>
<p>- Taught in secret by the Illuminated Order of the Silver Dawn, to those who have proven themselves ready for the first steps</p>
<p>I. Know that between the mortal world and the Divine Light lie seven veils - barriers of perception that separate the sleeping soul from full awareness of its own nature.</p>
<p>II. The first veil is the Veil of Flesh. The soul, wrapped in a body, forgets that it is more than meat and bone. It believes itself to be the hunger it feels, the pain it suffers, the pleasure it seeks. This is the sleep of beasts.</p>
<p>III. To pierce the first veil is to recognize: I have a body, but I am not my body. The initiate who understands this no longer fears death as ending, for they know the soul continues when flesh fails.</p>
<p>IV. The second veil is the Veil of Passion. Beyond flesh lies feeling - desire and fear, love and hate. Many who pierce the first veil become trapped here, believing themselves to be their emotions.</p>
<p>V. To pierce the second veil is to recognize: I have feelings, but I am not my feelings. The initiate who understands this can observe their passions without being ruled by them.</p>
<p>VI. The third veil is the Veil of Thought. Beyond passion lies the mind - beliefs, opinions, the endless chatter of consciousness. This is the most seductive veil, for the mind believes it is the self.</p>
<p>VII. To pierce the third veil is to recognize: I have thoughts, but I am not my thoughts. The initiate who understands this discovers the silence beneath the noise - the witness who observes the mind.</p>
<p>VIII. The fourth veil is the Veil of Self. Beyond thought lies identity itself - the sense of being a separate being, distinct from all others. This veil is woven from a lifetime of believing &quot;I am this, not that.&quot;</p>
<p>IX. To pierce the fourth veil is the great death before death. The initiate must release their grip on who they believe themselves to be. Many turn back at this threshold, for it feels like annihilation.</p>
<p>X. Know that those who pass the fourth veil discover not emptiness but fullness - the recognition that the self was never separate, that the boundaries were always illusion. They see themselves in all things and all things in themselves.</p>
<p>XI. The fifth veil is the Veil of Time. Beyond the illusion of self lies the illusion of sequence - past, present, future flowing in one direction. The initiate who has come this far begins to see time as the gods see it: all moments existing simultaneously.</p>
<p>XII. To pierce the fifth veil is to step outside the river while still standing within it. Such initiates may glimpse what was and what will be, though they must be cautious - knowledge of the future can trap as surely as ignorance.</p>
<p>XIII. The sixth veil is the Veil of Form. Beyond time lies the realm of pure pattern - the archetypes from which all things are shaped. Here dwell the ideas of fire before there was flame, the concept of love before there were lovers.</p>
<p>XIV. Few mortals pierce the sixth veil and return unchanged. Those who do become channels for archetypal forces - heroes who embody courage itself, lovers who become love itself, seekers who become the search.</p>
<p>XV. The seventh veil is the Veil of Light. Beyond form lies the source - the undifferentiated radiance of the Black Sun, the unity from which all multiplicity springs. To pierce this veil is to return to the beginning.</p>
<p>XVI. Know that none pierce the seventh veil while still incarnate. It is the final threshold, crossed only when the soul has completed its journey and is ready to merge back with the source - or to become a new source itself.</p>
<p>XVII. The path is not walked in one lifetime. Each incarnation offers the opportunity to thin one veil or another. The work accumulates across ages, the soul slowly remembering what it has always known.</p>
<p>XVIII. Let the seeker be patient. The veils part for those who approach with humility and persistence. Rush the journey, and you will be thrown back. Accept the pace of wisdom, and each step brings you closer to the light you seek.</p>

<h3>The Forbidden Arts</h3>
<p>There are arts that the wise do not practice, not because they lack power, but because they possess too much. What follows speaks of the forbidden paths - the magics that demand prices no sane soul would pay. Let this knowledge serve as warning, not invitation.</p>
<p>- Excerpted from the Index Prohibitorum, maintained by the Conclave of Mages, listing those arts whose practice warrants death without trial</p>
<p>I. When Tohu wove magic into the world, she wove it in patterns of balance. For every taking, a giving. For every binding, a release. This is the natural way of the arcane - a conversation, not a conquest.</p>
<p>II. Know that there are those who refuse this balance. They discovered ways to take without giving, to bind without releasing. These are the forbidden arts, and they carry consequences that extend beyond a single lifetime.</p>
<p>III. The first forbidden art is Blood Magic. Blood carries the essence of life itself - the accumulated power of a soul&#x27;s incarnation. To spill blood in ritual is to spend currency not your own.</p>
<p>IV. Know that blood freely given has power. Blood taken by force has more. This is the terrible truth that tempts the ambitious: the suffering of others can fuel workings beyond natural limits.</p>
<p>V. But blood remembers. The souls whose blood is stolen do not forget. They wait beyond death for the blood mage, and what was taken is repaid with interest across incarnations of torment.</p>
<p>VI. The second forbidden art is Soul Binding. To trap a soul - preventing its passage to Tatsu&#x27;s realm, forcing it to serve the binder&#x27;s will - is to interrupt the great cycle itself.</p>
<p>VII. Know that bound souls do not remain sane. Cut off from the wheel of rebirth, they decay into something neither living nor properly dead. The mage who creates such servants creates monsters that will eventually turn upon their creator.</p>
<p>VIII. The third forbidden art is Void Speaking. To call upon the entities that dwell in the spaces between worlds is to invite attention that can never be fully dismissed.</p>
<p>IX. Know that the Hungry do not understand bargains as mortals do. What seems like a fair exchange to you is merely the first taste to them. Once you have opened a door, you cannot fully close it.</p>
<p>X. The fourth forbidden art is True Name Theft. To steal another&#x27;s True Name is to steal their very selfhood - to possess them more completely than any chain could bind.</p>
<p>XI. Know that this violation echoes through all of a soul&#x27;s incarnations. Past and future selves are tainted by the theft. The universe itself bends toward balancing this wrong, and the thief becomes the target of forces beyond mortal comprehension.</p>
<p>XII. The fifth forbidden art is Time Unweaving. To reach into the past and change what was is to create paradox - wounds in the fabric of causation that never fully heal.</p>
<p>XIII. Know that those who unweave time do not escape it. They create loops in which they are forever trapped, living the consequences of changes that unmake the very selves who made them.</p>
<p>XIV. Why do the forbidden arts tempt? Because they work. A blood mage can accomplish in a moment what a careful practitioner requires years to achieve. Power without patience is the siren song of corruption.</p>
<p>XV. Know that the Sunken City fell to forbidden arts. Its king, Malcath, practiced all five and invented more. For a time, he wielded power that rivaled the gods. Then the price came due.</p>
<p>XVI. What sleeps beneath the Lake of Shadows is what remains of his workings - or perhaps what his workings summoned. The distinction ceased to matter long ago.</p>
<p>XVII. Let the seeker understand: power is not the goal. Wisdom is the goal. Power in the hands of the unwise destroys the wielder before it destroys anything else. The forbidden arts are shortcuts that lead only to dead ends.</p>
<p>XVIII. If you encounter one who practices these arts, flee. If you cannot flee, fight. And if you find yourself tempted to walk these paths, remember: every practitioner believed they would be the exception. None were.</p>

<h3>The Cycle of Ages</h3>
<p>The tall folk measure time in years, building calendars and marking anniversaries. They do not see what we see: that time moves in great wheels within wheels, each cycle a breath of the cosmos. What rises will fall. What falls will rise. The only constant is the turning.</p>
<p>- Recited by the Stone Speakers of the Dwarven Deep Halls, who read the ages in the layered rock and know that even mountains are temporary</p>
<p>I. Know that the Black Sun does not create once and rest. It breathes in cycles beyond mortal counting - gathering, releasing, gathering again. Each breath is an age of ages.</p>
<p>II. Three times before this creation, the Black Sun released its light. Three times, universes bloomed and flourished and faded. Three times, all that existed returned to the source. We dwell in the fourth exhalation.</p>
<p>III. Within each great breath lie lesser cycles. The rise and fall of empires. The waxing and waning of magic. The awakening and sleeping of gods. All follow patterns that repeat with variations.</p>
<p>IV. Know that Aedelore itself moves through ages. The Age of Shaping, when the gods walked openly. The Age of Magic, when their gifts flowed freely. The Age of Silence, when those gifts were withdrawn. And now, the Age of Awakening, when what slept begins to stir.</p>
<p>V. Each age carries its own character. The Age of Shaping was wonder and creation. The Age of Magic was power and pride. The Age of Silence was loss and learning. What will define this age has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>VI. Know that the turnings of ages are not gentle. They are marked by upheaval - wars, cataclysms, the death of old ways and the painful birth of new ones. We stand now at such a turning.</p>
<p>VII. The signs are clear to those who can read them. Magic returns in unpredictable surges. Ancient evils stir in their prisons. Prophecies converge. The wheel turns, and none can stop its motion.</p>
<p>VIII. Yet know this comfort: destruction is not ending. Winter is not death but rest. The age that passes makes way for the age that comes. Those who cling to what was will suffer; those who embrace what is becoming will find their place in the new pattern.</p>
<p>IX. The Elves have seen ages turn before. This is the source of their melancholy - they remember glories that will never return, beauties that existed only in times now past. Yet they also carry hope, for they know that new glories await.</p>
<p>X. The Dwarves read the cycles in stone. Each layer of rock tells of an age - periods of volcanic fury, epochs of patient sedimentation, catastrophic shifts that rewrote the shape of continents. The stone teaches patience.</p>
<p>XI. Know that the Halflings alone remember the purpose of cycles. They understand that repetition is not meaningless - it is education. The cosmos learns through iteration, refining itself with each turning of the wheel.</p>
<p>XII. What was learned in the first creation informs the second. What was lost in the second is recovered in the third. Each cycle carries forward the wisdom of those before, even when individual souls forget.</p>
<p>XIII. The prophets speak of a final age - a turning of the wheel so complete that the wheel itself transforms. They call it the Age of Return, when the scattered light gathers back to its source.</p>
<p>XIV. Know that this is not annihilation but completion. The journey of consciousness, begun when the Black Sun first released its breath, finds its destination. What has been separate becomes unified. What has been seeking finds.</p>
<p>XV. Is this age the final turning? The prophecies are unclear. Perhaps there are cycles beyond cycles, wheels within wheels that stretch into infinities no mortal mind can grasp. Perhaps completion itself is merely another beginning.</p>
<p>XVI. Let the seeker not be troubled by vastness. You need not understand the cosmic cycles to participate in them. Each choice you make, each act of wisdom or folly, contributes to the turning. You are small, but you are not insignificant.</p>
<p>XVII. The wheel turns. This is neither good nor bad - it simply is. Align yourself with the turning, and you move with grace. Resist the turning, and you are ground beneath it. The choice, as always, is yours.</p>
<p>XVIII. Know that this moment - this exact moment in which you read these words - has happened before and will happen again, with variations. You have faced this choice in other cycles. What you do with it now echoes both backward and forward through time.</p>

<h3>The Spirits of the Land</h3>
<p>You see the world as empty of spirit - stone that is merely stone, water that is merely water. Open your eyes. Every stream has its guardian, every grove its watcher, every mountain its ancient dreamer. The land is alive, and it is watching you.</p>
<p>- Spoken by the Wild Speakers of the Alfwyld, who have never lost the ability to hear what the land has to say</p>
<p>I. When the Dragon Aspects shaped Aedelore, they did not create a dead world and then add life to it. The world itself was alive from the first moment - consciousness woven into its very substance.</p>
<p>II. Know that the rivers are not merely water flowing downhill. Each river carries a spirit - an awareness that remembers every drop that has ever joined its flow and every creature that has ever drunk from its waters.</p>
<p>III. The river spirits are patient and generous, giving freely to all who approach with respect. But they do not forget pollution, damming, or disrespect. Their vengeance comes slowly, but it comes.</p>
<p>IV. Know that the forests breathe with a single vast consciousness. Each tree is a thought in a mind that spans continents. What happens to one tree is felt by all. The forest remembers those who harm it, and those who protect it.</p>
<p>V. The Elves understood this once, before pride clouded their vision. They built their cities as conversations with the forest, not impositions upon it. Where they have forgotten this wisdom, the forest has begun to forget them.</p>
<p>VI. Know that the mountains are the oldest dreamers. Their spirits move in time so slow that mortal lives pass like heartbeats. A mountain spirit may take a century to form a single thought - but that thought, once formed, is unshakeable.</p>
<p>VII. The Dwarves learned to listen to mountain spirits. This is the true secret of their craft - they do not force stone to take shape, they ask the mountain what shape it wishes to reveal. The mountain, pleased by this respect, guides their hands.</p>
<p>VIII. Know that fire too has spirits - quick, hungry, dancing on the edge between creation and destruction. Fire spirits are the most dangerous to treat with, for they do not understand the concept of &quot;enough.&quot;</p>
<p>IX. Yet fire blessed is fire contained. The hearth-fire that warms a home is a fire spirit that has chosen to serve, bound by the simple magic of gratitude. Those who thank their fires find them burning longer and warmer.</p>
<p>X. Know that the wind carries spirits that have never touched earth - beings of pure movement, impossible to bind, difficult even to perceive. They whisper secrets gathered from every corner of the world to those who learn to listen.</p>
<p>XI. Beyond these elemental spirits dwell others: spirits of places, spirits of events, spirits of ideas given form by collective belief. Where mortals gather in strong emotion, spirits coalesce like dew from morning air.</p>
<p>XII. A battlefield haunted by the dead is not haunted by the souls of the slain - they have moved on to Tatsu&#x27;s realm. It is haunted by spirits of violence and grief, born from the concentrated suffering of the dying.</p>
<p>XIII. Know that spirits can be befriended, bargained with, even bound - though binding is dangerous, for spirits remember. The wisest approach is alliance: offering something the spirit desires in exchange for its aid.</p>
<p>XIV. The Halflings maintain the oldest alliances. They do not command the spirits of earth and growing things; they are family to them. This is why their gardens flourish without seeming effort, why the land itself shelters them in times of danger.</p>
<p>XV. Know that there are dark spirits too - beings that feed on fear, that grow strong in places of death and corruption. These are not evil in themselves; they simply consume what others produce. But their presence signals imbalance.</p>
<p>XVI. Where dark spirits gather, something has gone wrong. The land is wounded, or the natural order has been disrupted. Wise healers treat the cause, not merely banish the symptom.</p>
<p>XVII. The greatest of all spirits is the spirit of Aedelore itself - a vast awareness that encompasses all lesser spirits, all living things, all stone and water and air. Some call this spirit the World Soul. The Halflings call it Mother.</p>
<p>XVIII. To harm the world is to harm a being that feels that harm. To heal the world is to heal a being that knows gratitude. Walk gently, and the spirits will walk with you. Walk with violence, and you walk alone - and watched.</p>

<h3>The Language of Dreams</h3>
<p>Each night, the soul slips free of its moorings and travels. You believe dreams are mere fancy - fragments of memory, nonsense of a resting mind. But the mages of the Oneiric Circle know better. Dreams are journeys, and the places we visit are as real as the ground beneath our waking feet.</p>
<p>- Taught to those who seek entry to the Oneiric Circle, whose members walk between sleeping and waking and return with knowledge from beyond</p>
<p>I. Know that when the body sleeps, the soul does not sleep with it. It loosens its grip on flesh and wanders - sometimes nearby, sometimes across vast distances, sometimes into realms that have no physical location at all.</p>
<p>II. The dream realm is not one place but many. There are shallow dreams, where the mind processes the detritus of the day. There are deep dreams, where the soul remembers other lives. And there are true dreams, where reality itself becomes fluid.</p>
<p>III. Know that in true dreams, the soul can meet other souls. Lovers separated by oceans find each other in the dream realm. The dead sometimes visit the living, bringing messages or warnings. The gods themselves communicate through dreams.</p>
<p>IV. Taninsam and Tohu, dreaming in Thorsheim, sometimes brush against mortal dreams. To be touched by a divine dream is to wake with prophecy burning in your mind - images so vivid they cannot be forgotten, truths so clear they cannot be denied.</p>
<p>V. Know that not all dream visitors are benevolent. There are entities that hunt in the dream realm - parasites that feed on the emotions of dreamers, predators that seek souls loosened from their bodies.</p>
<p>VI. This is why children sometimes wake screaming from nightmares they cannot describe. Their souls, inexperienced in the ways of the dream realm, wander into territories they should not have entered.</p>
<p>VII. Know that the trained dreamer can walk with purpose. They can choose their destination, maintain their awareness, and return with knowledge impossible to obtain through waking means.</p>
<p>VIII. The Seers of many traditions use dream-walking to see distant places, to peer into possible futures, to communicate across any distance. What the body cannot reach, the dreaming soul can.</p>
<p>IX. Know that the dream realm connects to deeper places - the realm of Tatsu where souls rest between lives, the formless spaces where archetypes dwell, even the edges of the Void itself.</p>
<p>X. A skilled oneironaut can descend through layers of dream into these deeper realms, though each descent carries greater risk. Many who have ventured too deep have never found their way back to their bodies.</p>
<p>XI. Know that dreams can be shared. Two or more dreamers, properly attuned, can meet in the same dream-space, creating a reality together. The dream covens use this technique to work magic that would be impossible alone.</p>
<p>XII. In shared dreams, belief becomes reality with terrifying speed. What one dreamer imagines, all experience. This is why trust is essential among those who dream together - and why dream-betrayal is the most personal of violations.</p>
<p>XIII. Know that the Halflings dream differently than other races. Their dreams are woven together, a shared space where past and present, individual and collective, blur into one. Their elders have dreamed together for so long that they are no longer entirely separate.</p>
<p>XIV. This is the source of their ancestral wisdom. When a Halfling elder speaks of ancient events, they are not reciting memorized history - they are remembering dreams in which they experienced those events through the eyes of ancestors.</p>
<p>XV. Know that prophetic dreams are not glimpses of a fixed future. They are views of probable futures - paths the river of time is likely to take. The future can be changed, but the currents that shape it are visible to those who dream truly.</p>
<p>XVI. To interpret dreams requires wisdom. The dream realm speaks in symbols, in emotions, in associations that slip away upon waking. Many have been led astray by taking dream imagery too literally, or not literally enough.</p>
<p>XVII. Let the seeker who would master dreams begin with awareness. Before sleep, state your intention. Upon waking, record immediately what you remember. In time, the boundary between sleeping and waking will thin, and you will walk between worlds with open eyes.</p>
<p>XVIII. Know that the greatest masters of dream-walking learn the final secret: that waking life, too, is a kind of dream - a shared dream of matter and time. To truly wake is to realize that the dreamer and the dream are one.</p>

<h3>The Eleven Seals</h3>
<p>That which is bound reflects that which binds. The seal and the sealed are one substance, divided by intention. What follows is the teaching of containment - how the formless is given form, how the infinite is made finite, how that which threatens the pattern is woven into the pattern itself.</p>
<p>- From the Tablets of Binding, attributed to no author, for the author was the teaching itself</p>
<p>I. In the beginning, all was unbound. Potential moved freely through potential, and nothing was fixed. This was the state before creation - perfect and sterile, complete and empty.</p>
<p>II. Creation is binding. To give form is to limit. To name is to separate from the unnamed. The first act of the Divine was the first seal - the Word that divided Is from Is-Not.</p>
<p>III. Know that every seal is a sacrifice. Something must be given up for something to be held. The bound thing loses freedom; the binding loses the possibility of what the bound thing might have become.</p>
<p>IV. Eleven is the number of the seals, for eleven is ten-and-one - the completion of the cycle plus the seed of the next. In eleven, ending and beginning touch.</p>
<p>V. The First Seal is Blood, which is life made visible. Where blood falls, intention takes root. The ground remembers what was spilled upon it, and that memory becomes law.</p>
<p>VI. The Second Seal is Name, which is identity made sound. To name a thing is to call it into definition. To withhold a name is to keep a thing in the realm of the undefined, where it cannot act.</p>
<p>VII. The Third Seal is Pattern, which is chaos made order. The stars do not wander; the seasons do not skip. Where pattern holds, that which defies pattern cannot enter.</p>
<p>VIII. The Fourth Seal is Dream, which is consciousness made free. In dreaming, the soul touches what the body cannot reach. The dreams of the wise are walls; the dreams of the foolish are doors.</p>
<p>IX. The Fifth Seal is Root, which is spirit made anchor. That which grows downward holds fast that which would rise. The deep places remember what the surface forgets.</p>
<p>X. The Sixth Seal is Division, which is power made diffuse. One will focused is a blade; ten thousand wills scattered are mist. In separation lies a terrible safety.</p>
<p>XI. The Seventh Seal is Silence, which is sound made absent. There are vibrations that unlock. Where these vibrations are not made, what they would unlock remains locked.</p>
<p>XII. The Eighth Seal is Light, which is presence made manifest. That which dwells in light cannot simultaneously dwell in darkness. To illuminate is to banish.</p>
<p>XIII. The Ninth Seal is Ignorance, which is knowledge made hidden. What is not known cannot be used. The forbidden texts are forbidden not from cruelty but from mercy.</p>
<p>XIV. The Tenth Seal is Witness, which is attention made vigilant. That which is watched behaves differently than that which is unwatched. The observer changes the observed.</p>
<p>XV. The Eleventh Seal is Will, which is choice made sacred. The decision to stand when falling is easier - this is the seal that no force can break from without. It can only be surrendered.</p>
<p>XVI. Know that seals do not hold by force. They hold by truth. As long as the truth they embody remains true, they endure. To break a seal is to make its truth false - and truth, once established, resists untruth.</p>
<p>XVII. The sealed and the seal exist in relation. Remove the seal, and what was bound pours forth. Remove the bound, and the seal becomes mere form without function. They define each other.</p>
<p>XVIII. This is the mystery of containment: the container is shaped by what it contains. The seal learns from the sealed. The prison becomes a mirror. In binding the other, we bind ourselves.</p>
<p>XIX. He who would strengthen a seal must strengthen its truth. He who would weaken a seal must corrode its truth. All workings upon seals are workings upon the nature of reality itself.</p>
<p>XX. Know finally that you are both sealed and seal. Forces are bound within you; forces are bound by you. The work of wisdom is to know which is which - and to choose, with full knowledge, what to release and what to contain.</p>
