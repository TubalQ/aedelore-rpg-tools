<h3>Creed of Shadows: The Creed of Noctara</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Silent Hand<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> Noctara, the Veiled Mistress of Shadows</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The followers of Noctara, known as The Silent Hand, are thieves, rogues, and shadow-dwellers who operate outside the bounds of traditional society. Noctara, the Veiled Mistress of Shadows, is a goddess of darkness, secrecy, and subtlety. She represents the unseen forces of the world-those who work in the background, shaping events without being noticed. To her followers, shadows are not a place of fear but a sanctuary, a veil under which they can move unseen, listen unnoticed, and act unopposed.</p>

<p>Noctara is said to walk the edges of the world, between light and dark, life and death, truth and lies. Her followers believe she created the first shadow, and in that void, she placed all the secrets of the world. Those who are clever, quiet, and cunning can tap into her knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p>The Shadow's Path: True power lies not in brute force but in subtlety. To follow Noctara is to master the art of influence, knowing when to strike and when to remain unseen.</p>

<p><strong>The Silence Within:</strong> Silence is the greatest weapon. Followers believe that to control one's emotions and thoughts is to control the outcome of any situation. Secrets Are Power: Knowledge is the currency of the shadows. No secret is too small or insignificant. The more you know, the more control you have over the world around you.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Dance of Lies:</strong> The world itself is an illusion, a game of deception. To win is to weave lies more skillfully than your enemies, to manipulate and guide others without ever being detected.</p>

<p><strong>The Veiling:</strong> Initiates into the Silent Hand undergo a ritual known as The Veiling, where they are brought to a darkened chamber to meditate in total silence for several days. This is said to bring them closer to Noctara's whispers and grant them insight into the art of secrecy and deception.</p>

<p><strong>The Night's Offering:</strong> Once a month, on the new moon when shadows are deepest, the Silent Hand gathers to make offerings to Noctara. These offerings are not of material wealth but of stolen secrets, whispered into the void. The greater the secret, the greater the favor Noctara grants.</p>

<p><strong>The Silent Step:</strong> Followers of Noctara perform a sacred dance of shadows during their rituals. This dance is a form of meditation and a tribute to the goddess, representing the delicate balance of moving unseen and unheard in the world of light. Sacred Symbol: The followers of Noctara use the Ebon Mask as their sacred symbol, a mask that represents their hidden identities and lives in the shadows. Many of the highest-ranking members of the Silent Hand wear physical masks during their rituals, though these masks are always of a simple, featureless black.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Hall of Whispers:</strong> Hidden deep in the underbellies of cities and forgotten ruins, the Halls of Whispers serve as secret meeting places for Noctara's followers. These halls are places of absolute silence, and those who break the silence within them risk invoking the goddess's wrath. It is here that the most guarded secrets are shared, and plans are laid for future heists and plots.</p>

<p><strong>The Black Vault:</strong> An ancient, lost temple dedicated to Noctara is rumored to lie in the darkest depths of the world. It is said that within this Black Vault lies the Shadow Codex, a book of forbidden knowledge that only the most skilled thieves have the chance of recovering. Many believe that whoever holds the Shadow Codex will become the greatest master of deception the world has ever seen.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong></p>

<p>The Silent Hand is led by the mysterious figure known only as The Whispered One. No one knows their true identity, and it is said they speak only through intermediaries, blending perfectly into the shadows. Below them are the Nightblades, elite rogues who carry out Noctara's will through acts of stealth and subterfuge. The Shadowbinders are the spiritual leaders, serving as priests and mentors within the Silent Hand. They are tasked with teaching initiates the deeper mysteries of the Creed, helping them master the art of moving in silence and keeping secrets.</p>

<p>The lowest level of the Silent Hand are the Veiled, new initiates who are still proving themselves worthy of Noctara's blessing. They must complete difficult trials of stealth, cunning, and deceit to rise in the ranks.</p>

<p><strong>Core Tenets of the Creed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Move in Silence: Never reveal your intentions or desires. Let others act while you remain unseen.</li>
<li>Knowledge Over Strength: Secrets hold more value than gold. Use what you know to your advantage.</li>
<li>Master of Lies: Always wear a mask, both literal and figurative. Let no one see your true self.</li>
<li>No Trace: Leave no evidence of your actions. A perfect heist is one where no one knows a crime has occurred.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> +1 Stealth and Deception<br>
<strong>Disadvantage:</strong> None</p>

<h3>The Shattered Path</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Shattered Path<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> Tatsu</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Shattered Path is followed by those cast out from, or who have rejected, the structured societies of Aedelore. Whether they be human, dwarf, elf, halfling, or any other race, these individuals share one thing in common: they live on the fringes, finding freedom in the rejection of norms and order. They do not adhere to any single race's beliefs, laws, or gods, but instead follow a loose, personal creed of survival, self-determination, and acceptance of life's harsh realities.</p>

<p>The dragon god Tatsu, is recognized as a symbol of exile, mystery, and the unseen forces that govern those who live in the shadows of the world. Tatsu is not prayed to in the traditional sense, nor are offerings made to them. Instead, Tatsu is acknowledged as a reflection of the outcasts' existence-someone who walks in the spaces between light and dark, society and wilderness, past and future. Outcasts do not seek favor from Tatsu, but instead, draw strength from their own isolation, from their ability to endure, and from their defiance of the established order.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Broken Are Stronger:</strong> Those who have been rejected, cast out, or who have walked away from the world's expectations are stronger for it. Like a bone that has healed after being broken, they grow harder, sharper, and more resilient. The Shattered Path teaches that scars-whether emotional or physical-are marks of strength.</p>

<p><strong>Survival Over Honor:</strong> In the world of the Outcasts, survival is paramount. Honor, tradition, and laws mean little when faced with the brutal truths of life beyond the walls of society. Pragmatism and resourcefulness take precedence over abstract ideals, and the ability to adapt is the highest virtue.</p>

<p><strong>The Wilderness as Truth:</strong> The natural world is their sanctuary, untainted by the rules of kingdoms and cities. Outcasts learn to read the signs of the wild, to trust in the rhythms of nature, and to find wisdom in the untamed. They believe the wilderness is where truth can be found, raw and pure, unlike the masks worn by the people of the civilized world.</p>

<p><strong>Embrace the Shadows:</strong> The Outcasts embrace the shadows-the unknown, the forgotten, and the abandoned aspects of the world. They do not shy away from the hidden corners of life or the darker aspects of their own existence. Shadows, in this belief, are not evil, but necessary: they represent the freedom of living unbound by the light of society's gaze.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Rite of the Forsaken:</strong> Those who follow the Shattered Path often undergo a personal ritual of severance from their former life. Whether they were cast out or left voluntarily, they mark this transition by leaving something important behind-a piece of their past that represents their former identity. This could be a symbolic gesture like breaking a cherished weapon, burning a family heirloom, or shedding their old name. The Rite of the Forsaken is meant to sever the ties to their former selves, allowing them to fully embrace their new life as outcasts.</p>

<p><strong>The Gathering of Shadows:</strong> Outcasts live solitary lives or in small groups, but occasionally, they gather in secret locations for the Gathering of Shadows. These meetings serve as informal councils where outcasts share knowledge, trade goods, or seek companionship. There is no leadership in these gatherings, only mutual respect born of shared experience. It is during these times that alliances may be formed, but they are fleeting, as trust among outcasts is rare and hard-earned.</p>

<p><strong>The Trial of the Wilds:</strong> Many Outcasts undergo a personal trial, often self-imposed, known as the Trial of the Wilds. In this test, they must survive in a dangerous or desolate area with little to no resources. The trial symbolizes their complete reliance on their own wits and skills, and their ability to endure hardship alone. Success in the trial is not always measured by victory or survival-sometimes, simply facing the wilderness head-on is enough.</p>

<p><strong>Mark of the Veiled:</strong> Some outcasts bear a personal mark or symbol of their life in exile. This could be a tattoo, a scar, or an artifact they carry with them. The mark represents their acceptance of their place outside society and serves as a reminder of their strength and independence. It may also signal to other outcasts that they walk the same path.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Symbol:</strong> None</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong> None</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> There is no formal hierarchy among those who walk the Shattered Path. Leadership is earned through respect and experience, not through titles or lineage. However, certain individuals known as Wayfarers are often seen as guides or mentors, having survived the hardest trials of exile. These Wayfarers offer wisdom to younger outcasts but do not impose authority. Newer outcasts are known as Wanderers, those still adjusting to life on the fringes, struggling to find their way.</p>

<p>While some may find a mentor among the Wayfarers, most learn to survive through trial and error, developing their own set of skills and instincts as they walk the Shattered Path.</p>

<p><strong>Core Tenets of the Shattered Path:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Survive at Any Cost:</strong> Survival is your highest goal. The world has turned its back on you, and you must find your own way to endure.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace the Wilderness:</strong> The wilderness is your ally and your teacher. Trust in the land and the shadows, for they will show you truths that cities never will.</li>
<li><strong>Strength in Scars:</strong> Your pain, your exile, and your broken past are your strengths. Do not hide from them; embrace them, for they are what make you whole.</li>
<li><strong>Walk Alone, Walk Free:</strong> Freedom is found in the rejection of society's chains. You walk your own path, answer to no one, and make your own way in the world.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> +1 in Perception and Insight<br>
<strong>Disadvantage:</strong> None</p>

<h3>The Silent Hunt</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Silent Hunt<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> The Groove Guardian, the Wild Spirit (a god of the hunt, nature, and survival, often depicted as a wolf/fox-like beast)</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Silent Hunt is the guiding creed for hunters, rangers, and those who make the wilderness their home. These individuals, be they human, elf, halfling, or dwarf, share a deep reverence for nature and the balance it maintains. They do not merely seek to survive within the wild-they are its guardians, protectors, and sometimes its fiercest predators. Their patron deity, The Guardian, the Wild Spirit, represents the untamable forces of nature, the predator and prey cycle, and the harmony that exists within the wild. Followers of the Silent Hunt believe that The Guardian watches over the natural world, not as a master but as a fellow traveler.</p>

<p>The Guardian embodies the wild, unpredictable yet balanced, and hunters who follow this path strive to embody the same traits: strength, cunning, patience, and respect for nature's laws. The creed teaches that the hunt is not a sport but a sacred act that maintains the delicate balance between life and death, survival and destruction.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Hunt Is Sacred:</strong> Hunting is a necessary and honorable practice, but it must be done with respect. Hunters of the Silent Hunt are taught to never kill without purpose and to honor the spirit of the prey they take. Every life in the wilderness has value, and taking it must be done with reverence for the natural cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Live by the Land:</strong> Followers of The Guardian do not merely survive in the wild-they thrive in it. They are skilled in tracking, trapping, foraging, and navigating the untamed land. They believe that true strength comes from understanding and living in harmony with the natural world. Balance Is Everything: Nature is a balance of forces-predator and prey, growth and decay, life and death. Hunters are charged with maintaining this balance, ensuring that no single force becomes too dominant. Sometimes this means culling a population of beasts to prevent overpopulation, and other times it means protecting vulnerable creatures from extinction.</p>

<p><strong>Become the Stalker:</strong> To truly honor The Guardian, one must become part of the hunt itself. This means adopting the traits of the wild-cunning, stealth, patience, and swift action. Hunters strive to be as silent as the wind, as swift as a hawk, and as strong as a wolf, blending into the wilderness around them.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Rite of the First Kill:</strong> Every hunter who follows the Silent Hunt undergoes the Rite of the First Kill, a sacred ceremony marking their entry into the creed. During this rite, the hunter must track and take down their prey alone, with no aid or tools other than those they can craft themselves. The kill must be clean and respectful, and the hunter is expected to offer a part of the prey to The Guardian in gratitude for the gift of life. The rite teaches self-reliance, respect for nature, and the importance of balance.</p>

<p><strong>The Moonlit Hunt:</strong> Once every year, hunters gather under the full moon to embark on the Moonlit Hunt. This event is both a celebration of The Guardian's blessings and a test of skill, as hunters set out to track and capture elusive prey under the cover of darkness. It is said that those who are successful in the Moonlit Hunt are granted The Guardian's favor for the year to come, blessed with sharper senses and greater stealth.</p>

<p><strong>The Bond of the Beast:</strong> Many hunters form a deep connection with an animal companion, a bond that goes beyond mere partnership. Known as the Bond of the Beast, this practice involves raising or rescuing a wild creature and forming a lifelong bond of mutual trust and respect. These animals-whether they be wolves, hawks, bears, or even more exotic creatures-fight alongside their hunters and share in the spoils of the hunt. It is believed that The Guardian blesses these bonds, making them unbreakable.</p>

<p><strong>The Vigil of the Stalker:</strong> During times of great hardship or when seeking The Guardian's guidance, hunters undergo the Vigil of the Stalker. This is a solitary journey into the deepest, most dangerous parts of the wilderness, where the hunter must survive alone for an extended period. The vigil is both a physical and spiritual challenge, pushing the hunter to their limits while offering them the opportunity to commune with The Guardian in the heart of the wild.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Symbols:</strong> The symbol of the Silent Hunt is the Claw and Feather, representing the dual aspects of predator and prey, and the balance between them. The claw symbolizes strength, ferocity, and dominance, while the feather represents agility, stealth, and The Guardian's teachings.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Cradle of Beasts:</strong> Deep in the wilderness lies the Cradle of Beasts, a sacred grove where it is said that The Guardian first walked the earth in animal form. This grove is protected by ancient magic, and only those who have proven themselves true hunters may find it. Pilgrims to the Cradle often leave offerings of food or fur in exchange for The Guardian's blessings.</p>

<p><strong>The Stones of the Hunt:</strong> Scattered throughout Aedelore, these ancient stone circles are said to have been built by the first hunters. Each stone is carved with the image of a different animal, and it is believed that performing a hunt near these stones ensures a swift and successful kill. Hunters often gather at the Stones of the Hunt to share stories and pass down knowledge to the next generation.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The Silent Hunt follows a loose, natural hierarchy based on skill and experience rather than formal titles. The most respected hunters are known as Wardens, individuals who have mastered the ways of the hunt and serve as mentors and protectors of the natural world. Wardens are often called upon to settle disputes among hunters or to guide them through particularly difficult challenges. Below the Wardens are the Trackers, experienced hunters who have proven their worth through many successful hunts and trials. Trackers often lead hunting parties and are responsible for teaching newer hunters the ways of the Silent Hunt. The youngest and least experienced hunters are known as Fledglings. They are still learning the art of tracking, stalking, and living off the land, and must undergo the Rite of the First Kill to ascend within the ranks.</p>

<p><strong>Core Tenets of the Silent Hunt:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Respect the Wild: The wilderness is not yours to conquer. Respect it, and it will provide. Disrespect it, and it will take from you.</li>
<li>The Hunt Is Sacred: Kill only what you need, and honor every life taken. The balance of nature must be maintained, for predator and prey are two sides of the same coin.</li>
<li>Live by Your Wits: Strength alone is not enough to survive in the wild. You must use your cunning, your patience, and your knowledge of the land to thrive.</li>
<li>Become the Stalker: Move silently, strike swiftly, and become one with the wilderness. Only then will you truly honor The Guardian.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Disadvantage:</strong> None</p>

<h3>The Stone's Heart</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Guardians of the Stone<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> The Great Mountain, Father of Stone</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> Dwarves believe that their race was carved directly from the stone of the world by the Great Mountain itself. This ancient being, the embodiment of the earth's bedrock, serves as the foundation of dwarven belief. The Great Mountain is considered the eternal guardian of the deep places of the earth and the font from which all strength, wisdom, and endurance flow.</p>

<p>The dwarves view themselves as custodians of the earth, entrusted with shaping its materials but always honoring their origins. Mining is seen as a sacred act-when they take from the mountain, they must give something back, either through craft or ritual. The dwarven halls are always built deep within the earth, as they believe this brings them closer to the Great Mountain's heart.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Silent Vigil:</strong> The earth moves slowly, and so too must dwarves. Patience, persistence, and unwavering resolve are the virtues of the mountain. Craft and Creation: Through their work as smiths and artisans, dwarves mirror the creative power of the mountain. Every tool, weapon, or piece of armor is seen as a sacred act, drawing on the energy of the deep.</p>

<p><strong>The Deep Places:</strong> The deeper one ventures into the earth, the closer they are to understanding the mysteries of the world. Knowledge is hidden in the depths, and only the worthy can uncover it.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stonebinding:</strong> When a dwarf is born, a stone is chosen to be their lifelong companion-a piece of rock from the deepest mines, carried through life and passed on in death. At their death, this stone is returned to the earth, along with their crafted works.</p>

<p><strong>The Forge of Souls:</strong> During times of crisis, the greatest dwarven smiths gather at the Heartforge, a legendary forge believed to be directly connected to the Great Mountain's core. Here, weapons and artifacts of immense power are created to protect the dwarven people.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> At the head of the Guardians is the Stonekeeper, a sage who is said to commune with the mountain itself. Below them are the Deepforgers, a group of master smiths and stoneworkers who are revered as priests. The Stoneguard are warriors who protect the sacred caverns and relics of their people.</p>

<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> +1 in History and Perception<br>

<div class="section">
<h3>The Veil of Tohu</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Circle of the Shimmering Veil<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> Tohu, Dragon Goddess of Magic</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Elves of Aedelore worship Tohu, the Dragon Goddess of Magic, who they believe brought the gift of magic into the world. To the elves, magic is not just a tool but a sacred force woven into the very fabric of reality, and Tohu is the weaver of that fabric. She is both creator and guide, shaping the magical energies that give life and order to the universe. The elves believe Tohu exists beyond time and space, dwelling within the mystical Veil-a shimmering boundary between the physical world and the deeper currents of magic.</p>

<p>Those who can peer through this veil gain wisdom beyond their years, and it is Tohu who determines who is worthy of this sight.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Arcane Web:</strong> All living things are connected through magic, and to disrupt this web is to invite chaos. Magic must be used responsibly and with reverence.</p>

<p><strong>The Eternal Quest:</strong> Elves believe in the pursuit of knowledge above all. To understand magic is to understand life, and to misuse it is to fall into darkness. Tohu's Blessing: Those who are born with innate magical abilities are seen as Tohu's chosen, destined to act as her voice and hands in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Veilwalking:</strong> Elven mages undergo Veilwalking, a sacred ritual where they meditate for days, seeking to pierce the boundary between the physical world and the magical Veil. Those who succeed emerge with heightened magical power.</p>

<p><strong>The Weaving of Stars:</strong> Once every hundred years, elven priests and scholars gather for the Starweave, a grand event where they use magic to create intricate tapestries in the sky, representing the flows of magic across Aedelore. It is both a display of elven mastery and a prayer to Tohu.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The Weavers of the Veil lead the elven religion, acting as both high priests and scholars of the arcane. Below them are the Starborn, individuals believed to be personally blessed by Tohu, often powerful mages. The Silken Guard are elite warriors who protect sacred magical sites.</p>

<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> +1 in Arcana and History<br>

<h3>The Roots of Aedelore (Earthsong Covenant)</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Earthsong Covenant<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> The Spirit of the Land</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Halflings believe in The Spirit of the Land, an ancient force that embodies the living magic of Aedelore itself. To them, the earth is alive, breathing, and aware of all that transpires within it. The halflings are seen as its caretakers, born from the soil and entrusted with safeguarding the balance of nature and magic.</p>

<p>Their magic is rooted in the land itself, and they believe that Aedelore speaks through the natural world-through the rustle of leaves, the flow of rivers, and the growth of trees. To harm the earth is to harm the halflings, and they believe that through their communion with the land, they can heal it and maintain the magical equilibrium.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Whispering Earth:</strong> The land speaks in subtle ways, and only those who listen with patience and care can understand its voice.</p>

<p><strong>The Cycles of Nature:</strong> All things move in cycles-life and death, growth and decay-and the halflings believe they are part of this sacred dance.</p>

<p><strong>Magic in All Things:</strong> Magic flows through the earth like water, and it is not to be dominated but respected and used in harmony with nature.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Rootbinding:</strong> A ritual where Halflings gather under ancient trees to meditate and commune with the earth. They offer up small portions of their harvest as thanks to the land for its bounty.</p>

<p><strong>The Gathering of Seasons:</strong> A sacred festival held at the changing of each season, where the halflings perform dances and songs to honor the earth's magic. The land is blessed, and seeds are planted as part of their covenant with the land.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> At the head of the Earthsong Covenant is the Rootspeaker, a druidic figure believed to be in direct communion with the Spirit of the Land. Below them are the Earthbound, halflings who devote themselves to studying magic and the land's cycles. The Greenwatchers are protectors of nature, defending sacred groves and ensuring that the earth remains unharmed.</p>

<h3>The Flame of Taninsam</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Order of the Eternal Flame<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> Taninsam, Dragon God of Fire and Renewal</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The humans of Aedelore believe Taninsam is both the creator and destroyer, a god of flames who can both purify and devastate. To the Order of the Eternal Flame, fire is the essence of human existence, symbolizing passion, ambition, war, and enlightenment. Taninsam's fire is believed to have shaped humanity's path, giving them strength in times of weakness and guiding them to conquer the odds.</p>

<p>The myth tells that Taninsam once walked among humans in dragon form, guiding them through the dark times of the First War. His fire imbued them with the will to rise from the ashes. The greatest virtue to the Order is to endure trials by fire-figuratively and literally-so they may emerge stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Scorching Trial:</strong> Life's trials and tribulations are the fires that purify one's soul. Just as metal is strengthened in the forge, so too is the human spirit through suffering and struggle.</p>

<p><strong>The Dual Flame:</strong> The flame can destroy, but it also gives warmth and light. Humanity must embrace both the destructive and creative sides of their nature.</p>

<p><strong>Divine Justice:</strong> The wrath of Taninsam falls upon the unjust, but his mercy is extended to those who honor the sacred flames and protect others.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rituals of Flame:</strong> Human priests and warriors undergo The Trial of Embers, a rite of passage where they must walk through sacred fire to prove their worth. The more severe the trial, the more the participant is believed to be blessed by Taninsam.</p>

<p><strong>The Sunblade Festival:</strong> Held once a year, it is a massive celebration where warriors display feats of strength, and grand bonfires are lit to honor the god. Sacrificial offerings-often of valuable objects or symbolic food-are thrown into the flames as a mark of devotion.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> At the top of the Order is the Flamekeeper, a high priest or priestess who interprets Taninsam's will through fire-reading. Below them are the Emberguard, warriors who are both priests and protectors of the flame. Every major city has an Inner Circle of priests who manage the sacred flame and its followers.</p>

<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> +1 in Toughness and Endurance<br>

<h3>Nature's Embrace</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Order of Tiamat<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> Tiamat, The Steadfast God of Earth</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Moon Elves, unlike their more magically inclined cousins, worship Tiamat, the Steadfast God of Earth. Tiamat is the embodiment of stability, strength, and the eternal cycles of the natural world.</p>

<p>Moon Elves believe Tiamat created the foundations of the world, shaping the mountains and valleys with their hands and giving the elves dominion over the land and its mysteries. Tiamat represents the balance between stillness and change, embodying the unshakable might of the earth while also reminding the elves of the need for growth and transformation. Moon Elves see themselves as the custodians of this balance, ensuring that nature's cycles continue uninterrupted.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strength in Stillness:</strong> Just as the earth remains unmoved by storms, so too should the soul remain steadfast in the face of adversity.</p>

<p><strong>Cycles of Change:</strong> Life is a cycle of death and rebirth, and Tiamat governs this eternal process. Moon Elves believe in living harmoniously with nature's cycles, whether they bring growth or decay.</p>

<p><strong>Wisdom of Stone:</strong> The earth holds ancient wisdom, and those who listen closely can learn the secrets of the past and the future.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stonewarding:</strong> A sacred ritual where Moon Elves meditate near ancient stones or mountains, seeking guidance from Tiamat. They believe that through deep contemplation, they can hear the voice of the god within the stone.</p>

<p><strong>The Festival of Earthsong:</strong> A grand celebration that honors Tiamat's gift of life. During the festival, the Moon Elves plant trees, bless crops, and sing songs of praise to the earth. They believe that these acts of reverence will ensure the stability of their people for another year.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> At the head of the Order of Tiamat is the Stonewise, a revered elder believed to have direct communion with the god. Beneath them are the Earthen Hands, druids who act as protectors of the forests and mountains, ensuring the natural world is kept in balance. The Stoneguard are warriors sworn to protect sacred groves and ancient stones, acting as both defenders and spiritual warriors.</p>

<h3>The Soul of the Clan</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Bonebinders<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> The Spirit of the Clan</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The orcs believe that every clan has a Spirit of the Clan, an ancient force that embodies their collective strength and identity. This spirit is thought to be the soul of all the ancestors who came before, and trolls believe that even after death, their spirits remain bound to their bones. Orcs keep the bones of their ancestors as sacred relics, and wearing or carrying these bones is thought to grant strength, wisdom, and protection. The orcs see life as an eternal hunt, and the greatest honor they can achieve is to become part of the clan spirit after death. They revere the bones of the dead, believing them to be sacred vessels of ancestral power. Dishonoring one's ancestors by breaking clan traditions is seen as a grievous sin.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Bones of the Ancestors:</strong> The bones of the dead hold their spirits, and to carry these bones is to carry their strength.</p>

<p><strong>Clan Above All:</strong> The clan's spirit is more important than any individual, and orcs must always act in the best interest of their people.</p>

<p><strong>The Eternal Hunt:</strong> Life is a cycle of survival, and orcs believe they are continually hunting for strength, both physical and spiritual.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Rite of Bone:</strong> When an orc dies, their bones are ritually prepared and placed in the clan's sacred burial site. Warriors often carry fragments of these bones into battle as talismans, believing that the spirits of their ancestors fight alongside them.</p>

<p><strong>The Hunt of the Fallen:</strong> Once a year, the orcs hold a great hunt in honor of their ancestors. It is both a celebration of life and a ritual to maintain the strength of the clan spirit. The hunt is sacred, and each clan competes to see who can bring back the largest prey.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The Bonemasters are the spiritual leaders of the orcs, skilled in the arts of bonecraft and ancestral communion. Beneath them are the Skullbearers, warriors who are chosen to carry the bones of the greatest ancestors into battle. Each clan has a Bonebinder, who ensures that the rituals and traditions of the clan spirit are upheld.</p>

<h3>The Abyssal Veil (EVIL)</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Abyssal Veil<br>
<strong>Deities:</strong> Nyxora, The Shrouded Queen (Goddess of Darkness and Illusion) and Zelgor, The Ender (God of Destruction and Chaos)</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The followers of The Abyssal Veil walk a path of shadows, deception, and destruction, guided by two opposing yet intertwined deities-Nyxora, the goddess of darkness and illusions, and Zelgor, the god of utter destruction and chaos. They believe that reality itself is a fragile veil, easily torn apart by the forces of darkness and annihilation. In their view, existence is nothing more than a fleeting illusion, one that must ultimately be consumed by the void of destruction.</p>

<p>Nyxora, the Shrouded Queen, rules over the realm of shadows and illusion. She is a deity of subtlety, deception, and control over perception. Her followers believe that all reality is subjective, a manipulation of senses, and that true power lies in bending the world to your will by exploiting these illusions. Zelgor, The Ender, represents the ultimate force of destruction-the pure, unbridled chaos that consumes all things in the end. His followers see him as the inevitable conclusion of all creation. While Nyxora's domain is about manipulating reality, Zelgor's purpose is to erase it entirely, leaving only the void.</p>

<p>Followers of The Abyssal Veil do not see their path as one of evil, but of inevitability. Darkness and destruction are not to be feared, but embraced, for they represent the truth of existence-that all things must eventually fall into shadow and be consumed by the void.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Veil of Reality Is Thin:</strong> The world you see is an illusion. Nyxora teaches that perception is malleable, and those who can manipulate the illusions of reality hold the true power. Followers are taught to see through the veils of the world, and to bend those veils to their advantage.</p>

<p><strong>From Shadows, Control:</strong> Shadows are not just the absence of light; they are a tool of power. Nyxora's followers believe that by mastering the darkness, they can control those around them, deceiving their enemies and guiding their allies through manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>Destruction Is the Ultimate Truth:</strong> Zelgor's followers believe that creation is nothing more than a brief interruption in the inevitable march of destruction. All things must end, and his followers seek to accelerate that process. They believe that by embracing destruction, they can bring about a new beginning-or at least a release from the illusion of existence.</p>

<p><strong>Embrace the Void:</strong> The void is the ultimate reality. Followers of the Abyssal Veil view the void not as emptiness but as the purest form of truth. Everything returns to the void eventually, and those who embrace it will gain the power to shape or destroy what remains of the world.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Rite of the Shrouded Eye:</strong> To fully see through the illusions of the world, followers must undergo the Rite of the Shrouded Eye. In this ritual, they enter complete and utter darkness for days, deprived of sensory input. The goal is to break down their perception of reality, forcing them to rely on their inner senses, guided by Nyxora's whispers. When they emerge, it is said that they can manipulate illusions with ease, seeing through the lies of reality and bending it to their will.</p>

<p><strong>The Call of the Void:</strong> To honor Zelgor, followers partake in the Call of the Void, a destructive ritual where they bring about ruin on a grand scale, whether by collapsing structures, igniting fires, or spreading chaos in battle. The greater the destruction, the closer they come to embodying Zelgor's power. This is often done as a sacrifice, tearing down something significant to unleash the void's influence.</p>

<p><strong>The Dance of Shadows:</strong> This is a ceremonial practice honoring Nyxora, where followers gather at twilight to perform intricate dances, weaving between shadows and light. The dance is not just for worship; it is a display of their mastery over illusions. During the ritual, they conjure phantoms and manipulate light and darkness, making entire cities believe in false realities. The Dance of Shadows strengthens their connection to Nyxora and sharpens their powers of deception.</p>

<p><strong>The Final Eclipse:</strong> A rare and terrifying event, the Final Eclipse is a cataclysmic ritual meant to summon Zelgor's full destructive power. The sky turns dark, blotting out the sun or moon, symbolizing the end of all light and creation. Only the highest followers of the Abyssal Veil dare to perform this ritual, as it is believed to tear open the fabric of reality itself, allowing the void to seep into the world.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Symbols:</strong> The symbol of The Abyssal Veil is the Black Crescent, a crescent moon surrounded by swirling shadow. The moon represents illusion, ever-changing and shifting, while the swirling shadows represent destruction and chaos that lies beneath all things. It is worn by followers as a mark of their commitment to unraveling reality and embracing the void.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Whispering Caverns:</strong> A labyrinth of underground tunnels where no light reaches, the Whispering Caverns are said to be Nyxora's chosen domain. Followers venture here to receive visions and hear her whispers in the darkness. The caverns twist and turn, often leading to nowhere, testing the faith and cunning of those who enter.</p>

<p><strong>The Pit of Annihilation:</strong> Located in a forsaken wasteland, the Pit of Annihilation is believed to be where Zelgor's influence is strongest. Nothing grows here, and no sound exists beyond the wind. The pit is a vast, bottomless chasm where followers gather to offer sacrifices, both material and living, to the god of destruction. Some believe that those who enter the pit willingly become one with the void, gaining its power in death.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The Abyssal Veil is led by two high-ranking figures: the Shadowseer and the Harbinger of the Void. The Shadowseer is the highest devotee of Nyxora, a master of illusions and manipulation. They can see through the layers of reality and twist them to their will, often leading their followers in rituals of deception and control. The Harbinger of the Void is Zelgor's chosen representative, a figure who seeks to bring about destruction on a massive scale. They are powerful, ruthless, and feared even by their own followers. The Harbinger holds the power to summon chaotic forces to tear down kingdoms, cities, or entire landscapes. Beneath these two figures are the Veilborn, skilled illusionists and shadow manipulators who serve Nyxora, and the Voidcallers, zealots of destruction who seek to bring about Zelgor's apocalyptic vision.</p>

<p><strong>Core Tenets of the Abyssal Veil:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Reality Is an Illusion: What you see, feel, and understand is but a veil. Learn to see beyond it and control it.</li>
<li>The Void Awaits All: Destruction is inevitable. Embrace it, for it is the only true constant in the universe.</li>
<li>Control Through Deception: Power lies not in strength, but in the ability to make others see what you want them to see.</li>
<li>Bring the End: Accelerate the inevitable. Where you walk, leave only chaos and destruction, so the void may take its due.</li>

<h3>The Radiant Path</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Emberguards<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> The Eternal Flame</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Paladins and Holy Warriors who walk the Radiant Path are devoted to The Eternal Flame, a deity of divine light, justice, and purity. The Eternal Flame represents the unyielding force of righteousness that illuminates the world, driving away darkness and corruption wherever it takes root. Her followers are not merely warriors-they are beacons of hope and virtue, protectors of the innocent, and bearers of divine judgment.</p>

<p>According to their faith, The Eternal Flame was born from the first light of creation, a flame sparked from the heart of the cosmos. Her purpose is to ensure that truth and justice prevail and that no shadow of evil is left unchecked. Followers of the Radiant Path believe that by taking up arms in The Eternal Flame's name, they become her living flame, burning away the sins and corruption that plague the world.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Light Unyielding:</strong> The light of The Eternal Flame cannot be extinguished. Her followers must strive to be the same-unyielding in the face of adversity, unbreakable in their resolve to do what is right.</p>

<p><strong>Justice Tempered with Mercy:</strong> Though Paladins and Holy Warriors are tasked with punishing evil, they must also know when to show mercy. Forgiveness is as important as judgment, and redemption is always a possibility for those who seek it.</p>

<p><strong>The Flame Within:</strong> The strength of a Holy Warrior does not come from their sword, but from their spirit. The flame of The Eternal Flame burns within each of them, and it is through inner purity that they channel her divine power.</p>

<p><strong>The Scourge of Darkness:</strong> Darkness in all its forms-whether it be literal, such as the shadows of the night, or metaphorical, like corruption and deceit-must be vanquished. The Eternal Flame's followers are sworn to hunt down evil wherever it may hide.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Flamebound Oath:</strong> Every Paladin or Holy Warrior must undergo the Flamebound Oath, a sacred rite where they swear lifelong allegiance to The Eternal Flame. The ritual takes place before an eternal flame, symbolizing the purity and everlasting nature of their duty. Once the oath is taken, the flame is said to reside in the warrior's heart, granting them courage and strength in the darkest of times.</p>

<p><strong>Rites of Cleansing:</strong> The Eternal Flame's followers regularly partake in cleansing rituals, where they seek purification from any sins or moral failings they may have committed. This often involves bathing in blessed waters or standing vigil through the night in silent prayer, with the goal of reigniting their inner flame.</p>

<p><strong>The Dawn Crusades:</strong> Paladins and Holy Warriors frequently embark on Dawn Crusades-quests to bring light to dark corners of the world. These holy campaigns may involve vanquishing evil creatures, purging corrupted lands, or even confronting tyrants who oppress the innocent. Dawn Crusaders believe that wherever the sun rises, The Eternal Flame's justice must be delivered.</p>

<p><strong>The Vigil of the Eternal Flame:</strong> At times of great strife, followers gather around an eternal flame-often kept in the heart of their temples. Here they stand in solemn vigil, praying for strength and guidance from The Eternal Flame. It is said that the longer a warrior keeps vigil, the stronger their connection to the divine flame becomes.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Symbols:</strong> The symbol of the Radiant Path is the Flaming Sun, an image of a radiant sun surrounded by a halo of flames. This symbol is worn by Paladins as a badge of honor, often emblazoned on their shields or armor. It signifies their role as bringers of light and justice.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Temple of the Blazing Dawn:</strong> Church of Taninsam</p>
<p><strong>The Sunspire:</strong> An ancient tower of unknown origin, the Sunspire is where Paladins go to take their Flamebound Oath. The eternal flame housed within is said to be directly linked to The Eternal Flame herself, and those who kneel before it often leave with newfound power and divine purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> At the top of the Radiant Path is the Flamekeeper, a spiritual and military leader who embodies the ideals of The Eternal Flame. The Flamekeeper is seen as the living representative of the Eternal Flame on Aedelore and holds the responsibility of guiding the order in matters of faith, warfare, and justice. Below the Flamekeeper are the Emberguards, experienced Paladins and warriors who serve as captains in holy campaigns, guiding their brethren in both battle and faith. They are also responsible for teaching new initiates and ensuring that the ideals of The Eternal Flame are upheld without question. The initiates, known as Lightbearers, are new Paladins or warriors who are still learning the path of righteousness. They have yet to take their full Flamebound Oath but are already committed to the pursuit of justice and purity.</p>

<p><strong>Core Tenets of the Radiant Path:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Burn Brightly:</strong> Your life is a flame. Be a beacon of hope, an example of righteousness, and an unstoppable force for justice.</li>
<li><strong>Be Without Fear:</strong> Darkness cannot endure the light. Fear not the shadows, for The Eternal Flame will always guide you.</li>
<li><strong>Deliver Justice:</strong> Evil must not be allowed to flourish. Act swiftly and decisively, but always temper judgment with mercy.</li>
<li><strong>Uphold Purity:</strong> Keep your heart and mind free from corruption. The flame within you must remain pure, so it may burn eternally.</li>

<h3>The Black Rebellion (EVIL)</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Black Rebellion<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> Malcath, The Fallen Sovereign</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Black Rebellion is a religion founded on the principles of defiance, revolution, and the pursuit of ultimate power through chaos. At its core is the worship of Malcath, The Fallen Sovereign, a god who once ruled among the divine but was cast down for his ambition and thirst for domination. Followers of the Black Rebellion see Malcath's fall not as a tragedy, but as an inspiration-a testament to the strength of will, cunning, and determination to rise above all, even the gods. Malcath preaches that the established order of the world is built on lies, oppression, and control by false powers.</p>

<p>The hierarchy of the gods, the kingdoms of mortals, and the supposed laws of nature are nothing more than chains that bind individuals to weakness and submission. Followers of the Black Rebellion seek to break these chains through rebellion, destruction, and the claiming of power. They see themselves as agents of a new world, one where the strong rise above, and where the darkness of ambition, cruelty, and evil is not feared but embraced as the path to freedom.</p>

<p>The Black Rebellion views the world as a battleground between those who submit and those who rise. Only the bold, the ruthless, and the defiant can overthrow the established powers and seize control of their own fate.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rebellion Is Strength:</strong> The greatest power lies not in obedience but in defiance. Followers of Malcath are taught that rebellion, whether against divine powers, kings, or any authority, is the true expression of strength and freedom. To rise, one must first tear down. Embrace the Darkness Within: Unlike other faiths that value light or purity, the Black Rebellion teaches its followers to embrace the dark desires within-the ambition, cruelty, and lust for power that others fear. These emotions are not weaknesses but tools for dominance.</p>

<p><strong>Power Above All:</strong> The pursuit of power is not a sin but the highest virtue. Followers believe that they are destined to rule, and that those who are weak deserve only to serve or be destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Evil Is Freedom:</strong> The constraints of morality are seen as a lie imposed by the weak to control the strong. In Malcath's teachings, what others call "evil" is merely the true expression of one's desires and potential. By embracing evil, one can rise above the illusions of right and wrong and forge a new path of dominion.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Rite of Broken Chains:</strong> Central to the faith is the Rite of Broken Chains, a ritual of personal rebellion and transformation. In this ceremony, followers symbolically break free from whatever binds them-whether it be a physical chain, a vow of loyalty, or a deeply held belief. This rite represents the rejection of submission and the beginning of their path toward dominance. During the ritual, the follower must swear an oath of defiance to Malcath, vowing to rise above all who stand in their way.</p>

<p><strong>The Harrowing:</strong> The Harrowing is a brutal and violent test in which followers of the Black Rebellion must demonstrate their strength and ruthlessness by overthrowing an enemy, rival, or oppressor. This can involve assassinating a local ruler, burning down a temple of the "false gods," or destroying an entire community to spread chaos. The greater the destruction and terror wrought, the closer the follower comes to earning Malcath's favor.</p>

<p><strong>The Crown of the Fallen:</strong> Once a year, followers gather in a grand celebration of rebellion and power called the Crown of the Fallen. This event involves the crowning of a leader chosen through deadly trials, often resulting in vicious combat between those vying for supremacy. The winner is declared the Champion of Malcath, wearing the "Crown of the Fallen," a symbolic mark of Malcath's original rebellion against the gods. The Champion leads the followers for the next cycle, until they are inevitably challenged and overthrown by another seeking power.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Ascension:</strong> The most powerful followers of the Black Rebellion seek to undergo Dark Ascension, a ritual of extreme ambition and malevolence. In this rite, the follower offers a blood sacrifice, either of a kingdom, an army, or a rival god's worshippers, in a grand, symbolic act of defiance. If successful, Malcath blesses them with heightened power, and they ascend as avatars of rebellion, granted supernatural strength and dominion over others.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Symbol:</strong> The symbol of The Black Rebellion is the Shattered Crown, a broken crown twisted and bent, signifying Malcath's fall from grace and the rejection of all authority. It represents the followers' determination to overthrow the established powers and claim their own sovereignty. This symbol is often tattooed or worn as an amulet by followers, particularly those seeking to rise in rank.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Tower of Thorns:</strong> Deep within a ruined city lies the Tower of Thorns, where it is said Malcath first challenged the gods. The tower is a site of pilgrimage for followers of the Black Rebellion, and those who survive the journey through its thorn-covered halls are believed to gain Malcath's dark blessing. It is also where the Crown of the Fallen ceremony takes place, drawing the most powerful rebels and would-be tyrants from across the land.</p>

<p><strong>The Scorched Throne:</strong> This charred and ruined seat once belonged to a king who sought to defy Malcath but was ultimately overthrown by his own people. Now, the Scorched Throne stands as a reminder of the fragility of power and the glory of rebellion. Those who kneel before it to swear their own oaths of uprising often leave with visions of conquest and destruction.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The religion of The Black Rebellion has no formal hierarchy in the traditional sense. Instead, the faith is built upon a meritocratic system of strength and power-those who can rise and overthrow others lead. The current leaders, known as Fallen Kings or Rebel Queens, have all earned their position through acts of dominance and destruction. Below them are the Black Heralds, emissaries of Malcath who spread rebellion and chaos across the land. There are no permanent rulers or priesthoods-followers must constantly assert their strength and readiness to lead, lest they be overthrown. The highest among them, the Champion of Malcath, holds temporary dominion over the followers until they are challenged or their reign ends in bloodshed.</p>

<p><strong>Core Tenets of The Black Rebellion:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rise Through Rebellion:</strong> Power is seized, not given. Defy all who seek to hold you down, and rise through their downfall.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace the Darkness:</strong> Ambition, cruelty, and evil are not to be shunned-they are the tools that will forge your path to supremacy.</li>
<li><strong>Destruction Is Creation:</strong> Only through tearing down the old world can you build your own. Spread chaos, sow discord, and claim the ashes for yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Rule or Be Ruled:</strong> There are no equals in this world-either you rule over others, or you are ruled. Never accept submission.</li>

<h3>The Arcane Creed</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Arcane Creed<br>
<strong>Founder:</strong> Auren Vale, the First Wielder</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The Arcane Creed is a revered and ancient order of magicians dedicated to the mastery and ethical use of magic. The Creed believes that magic is the lifeblood of the world, a force that flows through all things, connecting the physical and mystical realms.</p>

<p>However, they are not merely practitioners of the arcane-they are its stewards, bound by a solemn creed to protect and regulate its use. Founded by the legendary mage Auren Vale centuries ago, the Creed holds that magic is both a gift and a burden. Those who wield it must do so with wisdom and restraint, for its misuse could lead to chaos and destruction.</p>

<p>The Creed believes that only through rigorous study, discipline, and moral clarity can one truly comprehend the nature of the arcane and prevent its power from consuming the world. The central tenet of the Arcane Creed is balance. Magic, in their view, is neither inherently good nor evil-it is the intent behind its use that defines its morality. Thus, the creed emphasizes both the intellectual and spiritual growth of its members, ensuring they are capable of making ethical decisions as they wield the forces of creation.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Equilibrium of Power:</strong> Magic is not to be wielded for selfish gain or reckless ambition. The Creed teaches that true mastery comes from understanding the balance between creation and destruction, order and chaos, and using magic to preserve harmony in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge Before Power:</strong> The pursuit of knowledge is sacred, but it must be tempered by caution. Every spell, every incantation, should be thoroughly understood before it is cast. The Creed prizes study and preparation above all else, believing that knowledge is the key to controlling magic's vast potential.</p>

<p><strong>The Arcane Responsibility:</strong> Every magician has a duty to protect the world from those who would misuse the arcane arts. Members of the Creed are often called upon to confront rogue spellcasters, dark sorcerers, and others who seek to exploit magic for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p><strong>The Living Weave:</strong> Magic is viewed as a living force that binds all things together. The Creed teaches that magicians should respect this force, never twisting it for harm without just cause. The arcane weave is delicate, and reckless use can tear the very fabric of reality.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Trials of Auren Vale:</strong> To become a full-fledged member of the Arcane Creed, an initiate must pass the Trials of Auren Vale, a series of tests designed to challenge not only their magical prowess but also their moral compass and intellectual strength. The trials include solving ancient magical puzzles, navigating illusions, and facing spectral embodiments of their deepest fears.</p>

<p><strong>The Binding Oath:</strong> Upon successfully completing the trials, initiates swear the Binding Oath, a sacred vow that links their fate to the arcane weave. This oath binds the magician to the Creed's laws, ensuring that they use their magic for the greater good. It is said that if a member betrays the oath, their connection to the arcane will wither, stripping them of their powers.</p>

<p><strong>The Gathering of Sages:</strong> Every year, members of the Creed gather in a secret conclave known as The Gathering of Sages, where they exchange knowledge, debate ethical dilemmas, and decide on matters of importance regarding the use of magic in Aedelore. The Gathering is a time of reflection, study, and renewal of the members' oaths.</p>

<p><strong>Arcane Sealing:</strong> When dangerous magical relics or forbidden knowledge is discovered, Creed magicians perform an ancient ritual called Arcane Sealing. This complex spell is designed to lock away powerful artifacts or dangerous magic beyond the reach of mortals. The ritual requires immense focus and cooperation, often drawing upon the collective strength of several Creed members.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Symbol:</strong> The symbol of the Arcane Creed is the Interwoven Circle, representing the eternal flow of magic through all things. This intricate, overlapping pattern is often etched onto the robes of Covenant members or inscribed in their spellbooks. It serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of all magic and the responsibility to maintain balance.</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Tower of Auren Vale:</strong> The central hub of the Covenant is the Tower of Auren Vale, a towering structure that pierces the heavens. Hidden deep within an enchanted forest, the tower is said to house a vast library containing every spell ever written, as well as the ancient secrets of magic. It is here that initiates come to begin their training, and where the most powerful magicians reside in quiet contemplation.</p>

<p><strong>The Veil Sanctum:</strong> The Veil Sanctum is a remote island where the boundaries between the magical and physical realms are thinnest. It is here that advanced magicians go to study the deepest mysteries of the arcane, often spending months in isolation as they commune with the living weave. The sanctum is heavily protected by ancient wards, allowing only those worthy to enter.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> At the helm of the Arcane Creed is the Archwielder, a master of the arcane arts who embodies both the intellect and the wisdom required to lead the order. The Archwielder serves as the Covenant's spiritual and intellectual guide, responsible for interpreting the ancient laws of magic and guiding the direction of the order. Beneath the Archwielder are the Sages, powerful magicians who have passed beyond the trials and earned the right to mentor new initiates. Sages are responsible for preserving the Creed's traditions and often act as judges when ethical disputes arise within the magical community. New members, known as Acolytes, spend years learning the intricate nuances of magic, studying under the guidance of Sages. Before they can ascend to full membership, acolytes must demonstrate not only their mastery of spells but their ability to uphold the Creed's values.</p>

<p><strong>Core Tenets of the Arcane Creed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mastery Through Knowledge:</strong> Study is the path to true mastery of the arcane. Never stop seeking to understand magic's intricacies.</li>
<li><strong>Wield Power Wisely:</strong> Magic is a force of creation and destruction. Use it with care and with the knowledge that every spell has consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Guard the Balance:</strong> Maintain the equilibrium of magic in the world. Ensure that power is not misused, and protect the weave from harm.</li>
<li><strong>Pursue Ethical Truth:</strong> Magic is not just about skill but about wisdom and morality. Every spell cast must be done with purpose and responsibility.</li>

<h3>The Voices of the Forgotten Loa</h3>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Path of the Ancestors<br>
<strong>Deity:</strong> The Forgotten Loa</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> Trolls follow an ancient, shamanistic faith centered around the Forgotten Loa, powerful ancestral spirits that have long watched over their people. These primal spirits are believed to predate even the dragon gods, residing in the deepest parts of the natural world, such as ancient forests, mountains, and rivers. Orcish shamans communicate with the Loa to gain wisdom and strength in battle. The Loa are divided by aspect-war, hunt, blood, and survival. Each orc clan venerates different Loa depending on their traditions, and these spirits are called upon in times of need.</p>

<p>The trolls believe that blood spilled in battle strengthens the bond with the Loa, making sacrifice and ritual combat an essential part of their spiritual practice.</p>

<p><strong>Teachings:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strength through Ancestry:</strong> The Loa watch over their descendants, and honoring them through combat and survival rituals brings their blessings.</p>

<p><strong>The Power of Sacrifice:</strong> Blood spilled in battle or during rituals is believed to nourish the Loa and increase their power.</p>

<p><strong>Nature's Fury:</strong> The Loa represent the untamable forces of nature, and orcs respect them as wild and unpredictable entities. They believe they must channel these forces to thrive.</p>

<p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Blood Rite:</strong> Troll warriors engage in a ceremonial battle to spill blood in honor of the Loa, often held before major conflicts to ensure the spirits' favor. It is both a test of strength and a prayer for victory.</p>

<p><strong>The Dance of the Hunt:</strong> A celebration where the trolls hunt wild beasts in the name of their clan's Loa. The hunt itself is a form of prayer, and the strongest warrior claims the title of Loa's Chosen for a year.</p>

<h2>Songs of Aedelore</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>Songs of the Elves</h3>

<p><em>The songs of the Elves carry the weight of memory across the ages. These verses have been sung beneath starlight since our people first set foot upon Aedelore's shores, and in their melodies one may hear echoes of lost Elarion-a world we can never return to, yet never truly leave. Let those who hear these songs understand: to sing them is to remember, and to remember is to keep the light alive.</em></p>

<p><em>- Collected by Songweaver Illyria of House Lorendel, Keeper of the Eternal Melodies</em></p>

<hr>

<h4>Lament for Elarion</h4>
<p><em>Sung at the Ceremony of Remembrance when autumn leaves fall</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the void where starlight dies,<br>
There bloomed a world beneath twin skies,<br>
Where silver towers touched the dawn,<br>
And magic flowed like rivers drawn.</p>

<p>O Elarion, O Elarion,<br>
Your light lives on though you are gone,<br>
In every Elf who walks these lands,<br>
Your memory guides our weary hands.</p>

<p>The darkness came with hungry maw,<br>
And all we loved, we never saw<br>
Again-yet in our hearts it gleams,<br>
Elarion lives within our dreams.</p>

<p>We crossed the void, we found new shore,<br>
We built anew, we guard once more,<br>
For what was lost shall not be lost again-<br>
This is the oath of Elven-kin.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Starlight Vigil</h4>
<p><em>Chanted by the Night Wardens of Lorenzia at the changing of the watch</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We who watch when mortals sleep,<br>
We who guard the shadows deep,<br>
By star and moon we take our stand,<br>
The vigil of the Elven band.</p>

<p>For it is written in the sky:<br>
The darkness waits for watchmen's eyes to close.<br>
But we shall never slumber, never rest,<br>
Until the final shadow goes.</p>

<p>Light of Taninsam, guide our sight,<br>
Wisdom of Tohu, bless our night,<br>
As our ancestors watched Elarion's fall,<br>
So we shall answer duty's call.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Weaver's Hymn</h4>
<p><em>Sung by apprentices of the Arcane Creed during their initiation</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thread by thread the Weave is spun,<br>
By Tohu's grace, the work begun,<br>
Through Auren Vale the gift returned,<br>
The sacred flame within us burned.</p>

<p>We are the needle, magic the thread,<br>
We bind the living to the dead,<br>
We shape the world with whispered word,<br>
The silent song that must be heard.</p>

<p>Know then that power is not ours to keep,<br>
But borrowed from the endless deep,<br>
And those who weave must understand:<br>
The Weave flows through, not from, the hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>Song of the Silver Trees</h4>
<p><em>A children's lullaby, sung in the gardens of Rivermount</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sleep now, little one, beneath the silver bough,<br>
Where moonlight makes a gentle crown upon your brow,<br>
The trees remember songs from worlds now lost to time,<br>
And whisper them to dreaming hearts in rhythm and in rhyme.</p>

<p>The roots run deep, the branches high,<br>
They touch the earth and kiss the sky,<br>
And in between, where you now rest,<br>
You're held within the forest's breast.</p>

<p>Dream of starlight, dream of home,<br>
Dream of places yet to roam,<br>
For even when the darkness calls,<br>
The silver light will guard these halls.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Oath of Returning</h4>
<p><em>Spoken by Elven warriors before battle</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the light that burned in Elarion,<br>
By the void we crossed to reach this shore,<br>
By the blood of those who fell before,<br>
We swear to stand, we swear to fight,<br>
We swear to hold against the night.</p>

<p>If we should fall, let it be said:<br>
They did not flee, they faced the dread,<br>
And when our spirits cross the veil,<br>
We'll join the stars that never fail.</p>

<p>This is the oath, this is the vow,<br>
Spoken then, spoken now,<br>
Until the last Elf draws their breath,<br>
We guard the living against death.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Songs of the Dwarves</h3>

<p><em>The songs of the Dwarves are carved into memory as surely as runes are carved into stone. We do not merely sing-we remember, and in remembering, we honor those who shaped the deep places before us. These chants echo in our great halls, in our forges, and in the hearts of all who call the mountain home. Let those who hear them feel the heartbeat of the earth itself.</em></p>

<p><em>- Preserved in the Hall of Echoes by Choirmaster Grundin Ironthroat, Voice of Mount Basin</em></p>

<hr>

<h4>The Forgefather's Chant</h4>
<p><em>Sung in rhythm with hammer strikes in the great forges</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Strike the iron, shape the steel,<br>
Make it strong so it will not yield!<br>
Tiamat's children, born of stone,<br>
Forge the blade and make it known!</p>

<p><strong>(Strike!)</strong> For the mountain!<br>
<strong>(Strike!)</strong> For the clan!<br>
<strong>(Strike!)</strong> For the work of Dwarven hand!</p>

<p>Fire and stone and sweat and will,<br>
The forge burns hot, the hammer's skill,<br>
What we make shall last the ages,<br>
Written in steel, not paper pages!</p>

<p><strong>(Strike!)</strong> For our fathers!<br>
<strong>(Strike!)</strong> For our sons!<br>
<strong>(Strike!)</strong> Until the final forging's done!</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>Deep Roads Remembrance</h4>
<p><em>A solemn hymn sung at Dwarven funerals</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Return now to the stone, brother,<br>
Return now to the deep,<br>
Where Tiamat waits in darkness,<br>
To grant eternal sleep.</p>

<p>You carved your name in mountain halls,<br>
You forged your deeds in flame,<br>
And when the Stone Speakers sing of old,<br>
They shall recall your name.</p>

<p>The deep roads call you homeward,<br>
To caverns none have seen,<br>
Where ancestors sit in judgment,<br>
Of all that you have been.</p>

<p>Fear not the final darkness,<br>
For darkness is our friend,<br>
The stone that shaped our beginning,<br>
Shall also shape our end.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Lament of Amber's Call</h4>
<p><em>Sung by the exiled clans, forbidden within earshot of the fallen city</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>O Amber's Call, O Amber's Call,<br>
We built you high, we watched you fall,<br>
The void crept in through crack and seam,<br>
And turned our glory to a scream.</p>

<p>Thrain the Builder laid your stone,<br>
His children made your halls their own,<br>
For seven generations strong,<br>
We thought our home would last as long.</p>

<p>But pride, they say, digs too deep,<br>
And wakes the things that ought to sleep,<br>
The shadow came, the shadow fed,<br>
And Amber's Call became the dead.</p>

<p>We who fled still hear the drums,<br>
Still feel the dread of what there comes,<br>
One day we'll return with steel and flame-<br>
And Amber's Call shall rise again.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>Ale Hall Chorus</h4>
<p><em>A drinking song, shouted in taverns across Dwarven lands</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fill my cup and fill it high,<br>
We'll drink until the barrels dry!<br>
For Dwarven ale is thick and strong,<br>
And Dwarven nights are dark and long!</p>

<p><em>Chorus:</em><br>
Heave ho! The mountain's call!<br>
We are the sturdiest of all!<br>
Let Giants boast and Dragons preen,<br>
The Dwarves drink deep and stand between!</p>

<p>My grandfather drank from this same cup,<br>
His father too, and on and up,<br>
A hundred generations deep,<br>
This drinking horn is ours to keep!</p>

<p><em>(Repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>So raise your voice and stamp your feet,<br>
The night is young, the ale is sweet,<br>
Tomorrow brings the forge and mine,<br>
But tonight, my friends, we drink divine!</p>

<h3>Songs of the Humans</h3>

<p><em>The songs of Humanity are young compared to those of Elder races, yet in their brevity lies their power. We who were transformed from Elven-kind in the Age of Silence learned that life is short and precious, and so our songs burn with an urgency the immortal cannot know. These verses speak of hope, of perseverance, and of the stubborn refusal to surrender that defines our people.</em></p>

<p><em>- Gathered by Songmaster Aldwin of Tyralia, Keeper of the Living Tradition</em></p>

<hr>

<h4>Children of the Silence</h4>
<p><em>The anthem of Humanity, sung at festivals and gatherings</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were not born-we were made,<br>
Shaped by silence, unafraid,<br>
When magic fled and hope grew dim,<br>
We rose from ashes, fierce and grim.</p>

<p>We are the children of the change,<br>
Our lives are short, our spirits strange,<br>
We burn like candles in the night,<br>
Brief but fierce, our mortal light.</p>

<p>Let Elves recall their ancient home,<br>
Let Dwarves carve deep in mountain stone,<br>
We Humans look not to the past,<br>
But build the future, built to last.</p>

<p>For what is time to those who die?<br>
Each moment precious, each goodbye<br>
A reminder that we must not wait-<br>
We seize today, we make our fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Farmer's Evening Prayer</h4>
<p><em>Sung at sunset across the fields of Lutovia</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sun descends, the work is done,<br>
We thank the earth for all she's spun,<br>
The grain stands tall, the harvest near,<br>
Another day, another year.</p>

<p>Taninsam's light has warmed the soil,<br>
Tanin'iver's rain blessed our toil,<br>
We ask no glory, seek no fame,<br>
Just bread enough and roof from rain.</p>

<p>Bless this land, bless this home,<br>
Bless the children yet to come,<br>
And when our hands can work no more,<br>
May others tend what we worked for.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>March of the Freeblade</h4>
<p><em>A soldier's marching song, popular among mercenary companies</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Left, right, left, right,<br>
We march from dawn to night,<br>
Our blades are sharp, our purses light,<br>
But glory waits beyond the fight!</p>

<p>We fight for coin, we fight for fame,<br>
We fight because it's all the same-<br>
A sword don't care whose hand it's in,<br>
As long as it's the hand that wins!</p>

<p>From Tyralia to Borea's snow,<br>
The Freeblades march where battles go,<br>
We'll drink tonight and fight tomorrow,<br>
Trading joy for other's sorrow!</p>

<p>So left, right, keep the line,<br>
The Freeblades march through rain and shine,<br>
And when we fall, remember this:<br>
We lived more life than cowards miss!</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Healer's Hymn</h4>
<p><em>Sung softly by those who tend the sick and wounded</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>By Tanin'iver's gentle grace,<br>
I come to ease, not to erase,<br>
The pain you bear, the wounds you hide,<br>
I'll sit with you, here at your side.</p>

<p>Healing is not magic's gift alone,<br>
It lives in touch and caring tone,<br>
In patient hours and sleepless nights,<br>
In small compassions, quiet rights.</p>

<p>Rest now, let the body mend,<br>
I am your keeper, I am your friend,<br>
And should the darkness take you home,<br>
You shall not make that journey alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Songs of the Small Folk</h3>

<p><em>The songs of the Small Folk-called Halflings by the tall races-are not written in books or carved in stone. They live in the rustle of leaves, the babbling of brooks, and the laughter around evening fires. We emerged from the gentle dreaming of the earth, and our songs reflect that dreaming: simple joys, deep roots, and the quiet contentment of those who want for nothing but good company and a warm hearth.</em></p>

<p><em>- Hummed into memory by Rosie Tumblebranch, Songkeeper of the Greenhollow</em></p>

<hr>

<h4>The Earthmother's Lullaby</h4>
<p><em>Sung to children at bedtime throughout the Alfwyld</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hush now, little seedling,<br>
Close your eyes and rest,<br>
The earth is softly humming,<br>
And you are truly blessed.</p>

<p>The roots beneath your cradle,<br>
Hold you safe and sound,<br>
And all the growing things that live,<br>
Are watching all around.</p>

<p>Dream of sunny meadows,<br>
Dream of honey sweet,<br>
Dream of puddles perfect,<br>
For splashing little feet.</p>

<p>For you are earth's own child,<br>
And earth will keep you near,<br>
So sleep, my little seedling,<br>
There's nothing here to fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Planting Song</h4>
<p><em>Sung during the spring sowing, accompanied by rhythmic digging</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dig the hole and drop the seed,<br>
That's all the magic that we need!<br>
Sun and rain and time and care,<br>
Soon enough the green grows there!</p>

<p><em>Chorus:</em><br>
Hey-ho, watch it grow!<br>
Row by row by row by row!<br>
What we plant, we soon shall eat,<br>
Carrots, beans, and taters sweet!</p>

<p>Grandma planted, so did ma,<br>
So did grandpa, so did pa,<br>
Now it's our turn, dig and sow,<br>
That's the way the good things grow!</p>

<p><em>(Repeat Chorus)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>Wanderer's Return</h4>
<p><em>Sung when a traveler comes home after a long journey</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The road was long, the world was wide,<br>
I saw such things on every side,<br>
Mountains tall and oceans deep,<br>
Wonders that would make you weep.</p>

<p>But now I'm home, now I'm here,<br>
Among the folk I hold most dear,<br>
And all the gold in Dragon's keep,<br>
Is nothing to this welcome sweet.</p>

<p>Set a place beside the fire,<br>
Fetch the fiddle and the lyre,<br>
Pour the cider, slice the bread,<br>
Tonight I'll sleep in my own bed!</p>

<p>For wandering is fine and well,<br>
And I've got stories I could tell,<br>
But nothing beats-and this is true-<br>
Coming home to all of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Feast Day Round</h4>
<p><em>A circular song sung at celebrations, each verse overlapping the last</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pass the pie and pass the ale,<br>
Pass around another tale,<br>
Pass the laughter, pass the song,<br>
Pass the evening all night long!</p>

<p>Cousin Bramble, Auntie Rose,<br>
Uncle Pippin, bless his nose,<br>
All the family, gathered round,<br>
The finest folk that can be found!</p>

<p>Eat your fill and drink your share,<br>
Joy is best when joy we share,<br>
And when the morning sun appears,<br>
We'll do the same in another year!</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Guardian's Thanks</h4>
<p><em>A hymn of gratitude to the Groove Guardian, sung at harvest festivals</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wild Spirit, green and true,<br>
We raise our voice in thanks to you,<br>
For every fruit upon the vine,<br>
For every blessing, yours and mine.</p>

<p>You run through forest, field, and fen,<br>
Protecting all beyond our ken,<br>
The deer, the fox, the bird, the bee,<br>
All flourish under your decree.</p>

<p>We leave for you the finest share,<br>
Beneath the old oak, placed with care,<br>
A gift returned for gifts received,<br>
From folk who've always believed.</p>

<p>Watch over us, O Guardian green,<br>
Keep safe the spaces in between,<br>
And when our time comes to depart,<br>
May we return to nature's heart.</p>

<h3>Hymns to the Dragon Gods</h3>

<p><em>The hymns of the faithful echo in temples across Aedelore, praising the Dragon Gods who shaped the world from the ashes of primordial chaos. These sacred verses are not mere songs-they are prayers made manifest, offerings of voice and spirit to the divine powers who watch over creation. Let those who sing them do so with reverence, for the Six hear all who call upon their names.</em></p>

<p><em>- Compiled by the Ecumenical Council of the Six, from the liturgies of all temples</em></p>

<hr>

<h4>Hymn to Taninsam, the Eternal Flame</h4>
<p><em>Sung at dawn in temples throughout Aedelore</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Father of Fire, Light of Creation,<br>
First to stand against the dark,<br>
We greet the sun as your reflection,<br>
Your eternal, burning mark.</p>

<p>You who wrestled shadow itself,<br>
Who scattered void with sacred flame,<br>
We kindle fires upon our hearth,<br>
And speak with reverence your name.</p>

<p>Taninsam, Taninsam,<br>
Life-giver, light-bringer, warrior divine,<br>
Let your fire burn within us,<br>
Let your courage be the sign.</p>

<p>When darkness gathers, we remember,<br>
You have faced far worse and won,<br>
And in your light we find our strength,<br>
Until our final day is done.</p>

<h4>The Seekers' Chant to Tohu</h4>
<p><em>Intoned by scholars and mages before study or spellwork</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keeper of Mysteries, Weaver of Secrets,<br>
You who hold the threads of all that is,<br>
Grant us wisdom to perceive the patterns,<br>
Grant us humility before the abyss.</p>

<p>For it is written: knowledge is not power,<br>
But the path by which power is understood,<br>
And those who seek without discernment,<br>
Mistake the shadow for the good.</p>

<p>Tohu, Enigmatic One,<br>
Your Weave binds all things as one,<br>
In seeking you, we seek ourselves,<br>
The mystery has just begun.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>Prayer to Tanin'iver, the Serene</h4>
<p><em>Sung in houses of healing and beside sickbeds</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gentle wave upon the shore,<br>
Cool the fever, ease the sore,<br>
Tanin'iver, healer true,<br>
We place our trust in you.</p>

<p>As water finds the lowest place,<br>
And fills it with its gentle grace,<br>
So let your mercy flow to those,<br>
Whose suffering no other knows.</p>

<p>Renew the body, calm the mind,<br>
In your embrace, let sufferers find,<br>
The peace that passes understanding,<br>
The love that needs no commanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>Storm Blessing of Leviathan</h4>
<p><em>Called out by sailors before setting voyage</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lord of Tempests, Rider of Winds,<br>
We set our sails where sky begins,<br>
Grant us passage through your domain,<br>
Through lightning's flash and driving rain!</p>

<p>We do not ask for gentle seas,<br>
For calm brings rot and still air disease,<br>
We ask for challenge, ask for test,<br>
And faith that we will match your best!</p>

<p>Leviathan! Lord of the Free!<br>
We are but small upon your sea,<br>
But small things brave can weather storms,<br>
And reach the distant harbor's arms!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The Steadfast Litany of Tiamat</h4>
<p><em>Spoken by builders before laying foundations</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mother of Mountains, Foundation of All,<br>
On your strength we build our hall,<br>
Stone to stone and beam to beam,<br>
Rising toward the builder's dream.</p>

<p>What you support shall never fall,<br>
What you protect shall stand through all,<br>
War and winter, flood and fire,<br>
Still the foundation climbs higher.</p>

<p>Tiamat, Steadfast One,<br>
Your work is never done,<br>
Beneath our feet, you hold the world,<br>
Since time itself begun.</p>

<p>Bless these stones we place today,<br>
Let them neither crack nor sway,<br>
And when we rest beneath the ground,<br>
May our works still be found.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h4>The Passage Prayer to Tatsu</h4>
<p><em>Whispered at funerals and deathbeds</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Guide of Souls, Walker Between,<br>
You know the places we have been,<br>
And where we go when breath departs,<br>
You gather up our weary hearts.</p>

<p>Do not weep for those who pass,<br>
For death is doorway, not an impasse,<br>
Tatsu waits with patient grace,<br>
To lead us to our resting place.</p>

<p>What is lost can be reborn,<br>
What dies at night returns at morn,<br>
The wheel turns on, the soul flies free,<br>
Into the Enigmatic One's mystery.</p>

<p>Tatsu, Keeper of the Gate,<br>
We trust to you our final fate,<br>
And when our turn comes to depart,<br>
Receive us with a gentle heart.</p>

<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Human kingdoms<br>
<strong>Speakers:</strong> Nearly universal<br>
<strong>Script:</strong> Imperial Letters</p>

<h4>History</h4>
<p>The Common Tongue emerged from the trade pidgins that developed when human kingdoms first expanded. Over centuries, it absorbed words from elven, dwarven, and other languages, becoming the lingua franca of Aedelore.</p>

<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p>Relatively simple grammar makes it accessible to non-native speakers. Vocabulary varies by region, with local dialects sometimes barely mutually intelligible. Written form standardized by the Chroniclers Guild.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Default language of commerce, diplomacy, and daily interaction between peoples. All educated persons speak it regardless of race. Official documents produced in Common unless tradition demands otherwise.</p>

<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p>Musical and flowing, with subtle tonal variations that carry meaning. Extremely complex grammar with hundreds of verb forms. Many concepts have no equivalent in other languages. Script flows like water, beautiful but difficult to master.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Native tongue of elves. Language of high magic and ancient texts. Diplomatic language in formal elven courts. Many magical incantations must be spoken in High Elvish to function properly.</p>

<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Mountain kingdoms<br>
<strong>Speakers:</strong> Dwarves<br>
<strong>Script:</strong> Runic</p>

<h4>History</h4>
<p>Dwarves claim their language was taught to them by the stone itself. Whether metaphor or literal truth, Dwarvish sounds like the grinding of rock, harsh and resonant. It has remained almost unchanged since the First Age.</p>

<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p>Guttural and percussive, with sounds difficult for non-dwarves to produce. Rich vocabulary for stone, metal, and crafting - poor for abstract concepts. Script consists of angular runes designed to be carved in stone.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Spoken in dwarven holds. Used for crafting inscriptions and records. Many dwarves refuse to speak it to outsiders. Runic script carries inherent magical properties when properly inscribed.</p>

<h2>Death & The Afterlife</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>The Journey Beyond</h3>

<p><em>Theological treatise by High Mourner Valdris Gravekeeper</em></p>

<h4>The Passage</h4>
<p>Know that death is not an ending but a transition. When the mortal shell fails, the soul embarks upon its final journey - through the Veil of Shadows to the realms that lie beyond. What awaits depends upon the life lived and the gods honored.</p>

<h4>The Weighing</h4>
<p>Before the Gates of Eternity, each soul faces judgment. The deeds of life are weighed, the intentions examined. None may lie here, for the soul stands naked before truth itself. Most find their way to peaceful rest; some face consequences they earned.</p>

<h4>Eternal Rest</h4>
<p>The faithful of Elarion join the Eternal Light, basking in divine radiance. Warriors may feast in halls of valor. Scholars continue learning in libraries infinite. Each finds the afterlife their beliefs and deeds prepared them for.</p>

<h3>Funeral Rites</h3>

<p><em>Theological treatise by High Mourner Valdris Gravekeeper</em></p>

<h4>Human Traditions</h4>
<p>Humans typically bury their dead, returning the body to the earth. Funeral rites involve preparation of the body, viewing, religious ceremonies, and interment. Cremation is practiced in some regions. Mourning periods vary by culture and status.</p>

<h4>Elven Traditions</h4>
<p>Elves return their dead to nature through sky burial in sacred groves. The body is laid upon platforms for birds and elements to reclaim. Songs of remembrance may continue for years. Personal effects often buried at the base of a commemorative tree.</p>

<h4>Dwarven Traditions</h4>
<p>Dwarves entomb their dead in stone crypts within the mountains. Elaborate ceremonies seal the deceased with their finest work. Ancestor halls preserve memories through carved records. To die far from mountain stone is considered tragedy.</p>

<h4>Halfling Traditions</h4>
<p>Halflings celebrate the dead with feasts and stories, focusing on happy memories. Simple burials in family plots follow. Grave sites become gathering places for regular remembrance. Death is treated as natural part of life cycle.</p>

<h3>Undeath and Its Causes</h3>

<p><em>Theological treatise by High Mourner Valdris Gravekeeper</em></p>

<h4>The Unnatural State</h4>
<p>When a soul cannot or will not complete its journey, undeath may result. This perversion of natural order creates suffering for the trapped soul and danger for the living. Multiple causes can lead to this tragic state.</p>

<h4>Causes of Undeath</h4>
<p><strong>Violent Death</strong> - Souls killed in extreme violence may become trapped by trauma.<br>
<strong>Necromancy</strong> - Dark magic forcibly binds souls to corpses.<br>
<strong>Unfinished Business</strong> - Powerful purpose can anchor souls to the world.<br>
<strong>Void Corruption</strong> - Void energies twist the natural death process.<br>
<strong>Curses</strong> - Powerful curses may prevent peaceful death.</p>

<h4>Release</h4>
<p>The undead can sometimes find release through completion of their purpose, destruction of their physical form, or priestly intervention. The Knights of the Dawn specialize in granting final peace to these tortured souls.</p>

<h3>The Veil Between Worlds</h3>

<p><em>Theological treatise by High Mourner Valdris Gravekeeper</em></p>

<h4>Nature of the Veil</h4>
<p>Separating the realm of the living from what lies beyond, the Veil is both barrier and membrane. It keeps the dead from the living while allowing the natural passage of souls. At certain times and places, the Veil grows thin.</p>

<h4>Thin Points</h4>
<p>Ancient burial grounds, sites of mass death, and places touched by void magic often have weakened Veils. During Spirits Night, the Veil thins everywhere. Necromancers deliberately tear the Veil to work their dark arts.</p>

<h4>Consequences of Thinning</h4>
<p>Where the Veil is thin, spirits may manifest, the living may glimpse beyond, and passage between worlds becomes possible. This can bring comfort through contact with departed loved ones or horror as malevolent entities cross over.</p>

<h3>Ancestor Spirits</h3>

<p><em>Theological treatise by High Mourner Valdris Gravekeeper</em></p>

<h4>The Honored Dead</h4>
<p>Not all who die depart entirely. Some ancestors, through great deeds or powerful bonds, maintain connection to the living world. These benevolent spirits watch over their descendants, offering guidance and protection.</p>

<h4>Communication</h4>
<p>Ancestor spirits may communicate through dreams, omens, or during thin-Veil moments. Some families maintain shrines where ancestors can be consulted. Mediums and priests can facilitate clearer contact.</p>

<h4>Obligations</h4>
<p>Those who benefit from ancestral guidance bear obligations in return. Regular offerings, maintenance of family honor, and continuation of family lines please the ancestors. Neglect may cause them to withdraw protection or express displeasure.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>The Void and Death</h3>

<p><em>Theological treatise by High Mourner Valdris Gravekeeper</em></p>

<h4>Corruption of the Cycle</h4>
<p>The Void hungers for all existence, and death provides opportunity. Void energies can intercept souls in passage, corrupt the natural journey, and twist the dead into servants of entropy. This represents one of the greatest threats to existence.</p>

<h4>Void Undead</h4>
<p>Unlike natural undead, void-touched creatures serve the annihilation of all things. They spread corruption, tear at the Veil, and seek to drag souls into the Void rather than allowing natural passage. They cannot be reasoned with.</p>

<h4>Protection</h4>
<p>Proper funeral rites include protections against void interference. Holy symbols guard tombs. The faithful of Elarion actively patrol the Veil against void incursion. Those who work with void energies are condemned because their actions endanger all souls.</p>
