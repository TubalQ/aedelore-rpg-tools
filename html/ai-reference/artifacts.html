<h2>Legendary Weapons</h2>
<p>Weapons of immense power forged in times of great need. Each carries its own history and requirements.</p>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Dawnbreaker</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Longsword | <strong>Origin:</strong> Forged during the Grand Battle | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Vault of Heroes, Lorenzia
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Dawnbreaker is a longsword of golden steel that glows with inner light. Its blade never dulls, and in darkness, it shines like a small sun. The crossguard is shaped like spreading wings, and the pommel contains a fragment of Starlight Crystal from Elarion.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Forged by Elven smiths during the desperate days of the Grand Battle, Dawnbreaker was wielded by Commander Aelindris against the Void-touched armies. It has been carried by heroes throughout history, appearing whenever Aedelore faces its darkest hours.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>Dawnbreaker deals devastating damage to creatures of darkness and the Void. Its light cannot be extinguished by any means, and it can cut through magical darkness as easily as physical matter. The wielder gains resistance to fear and despair.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Dawnbreaker cannot be wielded by those who serve darkness or have been touched by the Void. It will not allow itself to be drawn by the unworthy.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Grondar's Maul</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Warhammer | <strong>Origin:</strong> Mount Basin, early Dwarven era | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Lost in Ambers Call
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Grondar's Maul is an enormous warhammer of black iron, too heavy for any but the strongest Dwarves to lift. Its head is inscribed with runes that glow like magma when the weapon strikes.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Forged by the legendary smith Grondar for Thrain the Builder, founder of Ambers Call. The Maul was used to shape the foundations of that great city and later to defend it. It was lost when the city fell to Void corruption.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>The Maul can shatter any material - stone, metal, magical barriers, nothing can withstand its blow. It also carries Tiamats blessing, making its wielder as unyielding as the earth itself.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Only those of Dwarven blood can lift the Maul. Many believe it still lies somewhere in the ruins of Ambers Call, waiting to be reclaimed.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Whisperwind Bow</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Longbow | <strong>Origin:</strong> Elarion | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Rivermount Armory
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Whisperwind is a longbow of silver-white wood that does not exist in Aedelore - one of the few surviving artifacts from the lost Elven homeland. It is nearly weightless and makes no sound when drawn or fired.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Carried through the Crossing by a ranger whose name has been forgotten, Whisperwind served in every major conflict since the Elves arrived. It was wielded by Faelyn Swiftarrow during the Siege of Rivermount and remains in the city it helped defend.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>Arrows fired from Whisperwind fly true regardless of wind or distance, and can strike targets the archer can see regardless of intervening obstacles. The bow also renders its wielder silent while drawn.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Whisperwind bonds with skilled archers and refuses to function for those it deems unworthy. The current bonded wielder is Captain Lyrien of the Rivermount Guard.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Soulreaver</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Greatsword | <strong>Origin:</strong> Unknown (pre-dates recorded history) | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Unknown
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Soulreaver is a massive black blade that seems to drink in light. Its edge is lined with silver runes that pulse with cold fire, and those who look at it too long report hearing whispers.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Soulreavers origin is unknown - some claim it was forged by Zelgor himself, others that it was created by the first Void-touched mages. It has appeared throughout history in the hands of conquerors and tyrants, always bringing devastation.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>Soulreaver consumes the souls of those it kills, adding their strength to the wielder. It can cut through any defense, physical or magical, and grants its wielder terrible power - at a terrible price.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Soulreaver corrupts all who wield it, slowly turning them toward darkness. Every known wielder has eventually been destroyed by the blade itself or by heroes seeking to end its rampage.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Frostfang</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Battleaxe | <strong>Origin:</strong> Borea | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Frost Giant King's hall
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Frostfang is a massive battleaxe of ice that never melts, its edge sharper than any steel. Cold radiates from it constantly, and those struck by it are frozen from within.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Forged by Frost Giant smiths with Leviathan's blessing, Frostfang was created to defend Borea against Nyxoras invasion. It has been wielded by the Frost Giant King ever since, a symbol of their people's survival.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>Frostfang freezes whatever it strikes and can project blasts of killing cold. Its wielder becomes immune to cold and can walk through blizzards unharmed.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Only those who can withstand Boreas cold can wield Frostfang. For most mortals, simply touching it causes frostbite.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>The Spine of Malcath</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Spear | <strong>Origin:</strong> Sunken City | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Depths of Lake of Shadows
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Once a beautiful spear of silver and sapphire, the Spine of Malcath is now a twisted weapon of dark metal and corrupted crystal. It still carries the power of a king - but that king fell to the Void.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>This spear was Malcath's symbol of office, carried during his reign as the wise and just ruler of the Sunken City. When he fell to Zarathen's whispers, the spear fell with him, corrupted by the same darkness that claimed its master.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>The Spine grants its wielder authority over water and the creatures within it - but also carries Malcath's corruption. Those who use it too often begin to hear whispers, just as Malcath did.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The Spine lies at the bottom of the Lake of Shadows, guarded by Malcath himself. Retrieving it would require confronting the Lost King - and resisting the same corruption that claimed him.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Oathkeeper</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Shortsword | <strong>Origin:</strong> Nortaq | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Hall of Accords, Lorenzia
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Oathkeeper is a simple shortsword of unremarkable appearance, yet it is one of the most significant artifacts in Aedelore. Its blade is inscribed with the text of the Treaty of Nortaq in letters too small to read with the naked eye.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Forged from the melted weapons of the First War, Oathkeeper was created as part of the peace process following divine judgment. Every signatory of the Treaty touched the blade, binding their nations to the peace.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>Oathkeeper enforces promises. Those who swear upon it and break their oath suffer increasingly severe misfortune until they make amends. It also glows in the presence of broken promises.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Oathkeeper serves no single wielder but is used in diplomatic ceremonies throughout Aedelore. Treaties signed in its presence carry additional weight.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Thornwhip</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Whip | <strong>Origin:</strong> Verdant Heart | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Grove of First Speaking
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Thornwhip is a living weapon - a length of vine covered in razor-sharp thorns that moves with its own will. It writhes constantly, responding to its wielder's emotions and intent.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Created by the Groove Guardian himself, Thornwhip was given to the first Archdruid to defend the wild places. It has been passed down through generations of druids, growing stronger with each wielder.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>Thornwhip extends to impossible lengths, can entangle multiple enemies at once, and inflicts wounds that bleed profusely. It can also command plants within its range to attack or defend.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Only true druids can wield Thornwhip - it attacks anyone else who attempts to use it. The weapon has its own personality and may refuse commands it finds distasteful.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Armor & Protection</h2>
<p>Legendary protective items that have guarded heroes and rulers throughout Aedelore's history.</p>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Aegis of the Six</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Shield | <strong>Origin:</strong> Grand Battle era | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Thorsheim (sealed)
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Aegis of the Six is a tower shield bearing the symbols of all six Dragon Gods. It shifts color constantly, cycling through the aspects of each deity, and radiates an aura of divine protection.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Created by the combined will of the Dragon Gods during the Grand Battle, the Aegis served as the last line of defense against Zelgor's final assault. It was instrumental in driving back the Harbinger and was sealed away in Thorsheim afterward.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>The Aegis provides absolute protection against Void attacks and can extend its shield to protect those nearby. It draws upon all six aspects - fire, water, air, earth, soul, and magic - to counter any threat.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The Aegis can only be wielded by one who has the blessing of all six Dragon Gods - a requirement so stringent that it has not been carried since the Grand Battle itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Mantle of Shadows</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Cloak | <strong>Origin:</strong> Unknown | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Worn by the current Shadow Hand
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Mantle of Shadows is a cloak of material that seems to be woven from darkness itself. It moves of its own accord, wrapping around its wearer in response to threats, and renders them nearly invisible in shadow.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The Mantle appeared in the possession of Noctara when she first betrayed Nyxora. Whether she created it, stole it, or received it from some unknown source has never been determined. It has been passed to each leader of the Silent Hand since.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>The Mantle grants invisibility in shadow, protection from magical detection, and the ability to step between shadows as if they were doorways. It also protects against surprise attacks, reacting faster than any mortal reflex.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Only those initiated into the highest mysteries of Noctara's faith can wear the Mantle. Others who attempt it find themselves lost in darkness, sometimes permanently.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Stoneplate of the Mountain King</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Full plate armor | <strong>Origin:</strong> Mount Basin | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Dwarven High King's treasury
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This suit of full plate appears to be carved from solid granite, yet moves as flexibly as cloth. It is covered in Dwarven runes that pulse with the heartbeat of the earth itself.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Forged for the first Dwarven High King by Tiamat's blessing, this armor has protected the rulers of the Dwarven people for countless generations. It is donned only for the most important battles and ceremonies.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>The Stoneplate is nearly impervious to physical damage and renders its wearer immune to fear, poison, and magical compulsion. It also allows the wearer to merge with stone, passing through walls or hiding within mountains.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Only the rightful High King of the Dwarves can wear the Stoneplate. It will not move for anyone else, becoming a statue trapping any usurper inside.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Windrunner's Vestments</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Enchanted clothing | <strong>Origin:</strong> Floating Monastery | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Floating Monastery
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These flowing robes of sky-blue silk never seem to settle, constantly rippling as if in a gentle breeze even in still air. They weigh almost nothing and grant their wearer extraordinary speed and agility.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Woven by the Wind Priests over generations, each High Windkeeper adds threads to the Vestments during their tenure. They have accumulated centuries of blessings from Leviathan's faithful.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>The Vestments allow their wearer to run on air as if it were solid ground, fall any distance without harm, and move with the speed of wind. They also provide protection against weather of any kind.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The Vestments are ceremonial garb for the High Windkeeper and pass to each successor. They serve adequately for any faithful of Leviathan but reach full power only for the High Windkeeper.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Healer's Shroud</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Sacred cloth | <strong>Origin:</strong> First Temple of Tanin'iver | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Distributed among temples
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Healer's Shroud is not a single item but a collection of cloths cut from the same sacred fabric. Each piece retains the healing properties of the whole, and all remain connected regardless of distance.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The original Shroud was woven from threads blessed directly by Tanin'iver in the early days after the Crossing. As the faith spread, the Shroud was divided so that each temple could possess a piece.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>Wounds bound with a piece of the Shroud heal at miraculous speed. The cloth also purifies disease and poison on contact. Through concentration, a healer can sense the condition of anyone touched by any piece of the Shroud anywhere in Aedelore.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The Shroud serves all who use it for healing. Using it to bind wounds while intending harm causes the piece to crumble to dust.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Crown of the Sunken King</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Corrupted crown | <strong>Origin:</strong> Sunken City | <strong>Current Location:</strong> Sunken City (worn by Malcath)
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Once a beautiful circlet of silver and sapphire, Malcath's crown is now tarnished black, its gems replaced with fragments of solidified Void. It still radiates authority - but the authority it grants is dark and terrible.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>This was the crown of office for the rulers of the Sunken City, blessed by Tohu herself. When Malcath fell to Zarathen's corruption, the crown fell with him, becoming a symbol of his tragedy.</p>
<h4>Powers</h4>
<p>The Crown grants its wearer command over water and the creatures within it, as well as enhanced magical abilities. However, it also carries Malcath's curse - wearing it exposes the user to Zarathen's whispers.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The Crown can theoretically be claimed by defeating Malcath, but purifying it would require power equivalent to what corrupted it - power that may no longer exist in Aedelore.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Wondrous Items</h2>
<p>Magical items of various kinds that serve practical purposes throughout Aedelore.</p>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Orb of Distant Sight</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Scrying device | <strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare | <strong>Known Locations:</strong> Arcane Creed towers, royal courts
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These crystal spheres, ranging from palm-sized to those requiring pedestals, allow users to see distant locations. The view appears within the orb as if looking through a window.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Focusing on a known location or person allows the orb to show that target, regardless of distance. Unknown locations require something connected to them - a map, an object from there, or similar. The view is silent; no sound travels through.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Powerful wards can block scrying. The target may sense being watched if sufficiently magical. Extended use causes headaches and eventual nosebleeds.</p>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>The Arcane Creed developed these orbs after the Age of Silence to maintain communication across distances. They remain expensive and relatively rare, used mainly by mages and wealthy institutions.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Waystone</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Transportation network | <strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare (individually), Unique (as network) | <strong>Known Locations:</strong> Major cities throughout Aedelore
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Waystones are standing stones inscribed with transportation runes. They form a network allowing instantaneous travel between linked stones - a system created by the Elves and later expanded by other races.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Activating a Waystone requires knowledge of the destination stone's true name and sufficient magical ability. The traveler steps into the stone and emerges from their destination instantly.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Each use is draining; most people can only travel once or twice before needing rest. The stones cannot transport large groups or heavy cargo. Some stones are restricted to specific users.</p>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>The Waystone network has shrunk since the Age of Silence - many stones were destroyed or their names forgotten. Restoring the network is an ongoing project of the Arcane Creed.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Everburning Torch</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Light source | <strong>Rarity:</strong> Common | <strong>Known Locations:</strong> Widely available
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These torches burn with magical flame that produces light and heat but never consumes fuel. They are the most common magical item in Aedelore, found in homes, dungeons, and everywhere light is needed.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Simply hold the torch; it ignites automatically when grasped and extinguishes when released. The flame can be adjusted from candlelight to bonfire intensity through concentration.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Everburning Torches are not weapons - their flame produces light and warmth but cannot set objects ablaze or harm creatures. They can be suppressed by sufficiently powerful darkness magic.</p>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>These were developed after the Age of Silence as practice pieces for apprentice mages. Their simplicity and usefulness made them the most widely produced magical item in history.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Bag of Holding</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Storage device | <strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon | <strong>Known Locations:</strong> Merchant caravans, adventurers
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These bags appear ordinary but contain extradimensional space far larger than their exterior would suggest. A typical bag can hold several hundred pounds of material while weighing only a few pounds itself.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Simply place items inside; they disappear into the extradimensional space. Reaching in while thinking of a specific item brings it to hand. Living creatures cannot survive inside for long.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Overloading a bag causes it to rupture, scattering contents across the extradimensional space (usually lost forever). Placing one bag inside another causes a catastrophic reaction.</p>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Originally developed by Dwarven merchants for transporting ore, bags of holding revolutionized trade. Modern versions are standardized, with their capacity clearly marked.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Translation Pendant</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Communication aid | <strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare | <strong>Known Locations:</strong> Diplomatic corps, scholar institutions
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These pendants, usually bearing the symbol of Tohu, allow their wearers to understand and speak any language. The words heard are translated automatically; the words spoken emerge in whatever language the listener understands.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Wear the pendant and concentrate briefly to activate. All languages are then comprehensible, including written text if held close to the pendant.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>The pendant translates words, not meaning - idioms, cultural references, and deliberate obscurity remain confusing. It also cannot translate languages it has never encountered; at least one speaker must be present.</p>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Created to facilitate communication between the races after the First War, Translation Pendants are considered essential diplomatic tools. Destroying one is seen as a hostile act.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Memory Stone</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Recording device | <strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare | <strong>Known Locations:</strong> Libraries, private collections
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These smooth stones from Elarion can store memories. When touched while focusing on a memory, the stone absorbs it; touching the stone later allows anyone to experience that memory as if it were their own.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Hold the stone and concentrate on the memory you wish to preserve. The memory flows into the stone and can be experienced by anyone who touches it and concentrates.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Each stone holds only one memory. Overwriting destroys the previous content. The memories degrade over millennia, becoming increasingly fragmentary.</p>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Memory Stones are among the most precious Elarion relics. The Keepers of Memory maintain the largest collection, preserving firsthand accounts of events from before the Crossing.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Sending Stone</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Communication device | <strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon | <strong>Known Locations:</strong> Military units, merchant houses
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Sending Stones are created in pairs, each linked to its partner. Messages spoken to one stone are heard from the other, regardless of distance, allowing instantaneous communication.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Hold the stone and speak; your partner's stone will vibrate, and when they touch it, your message plays. They can respond the same way.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Messages are limited to about twenty-five words. Each stone can only send once per day. If one stone is destroyed, its partner becomes useless.</p>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Sending Stones transformed military communication during the First War, allowing coordination across vast distances. Their widespread adoption after the war helped maintain the peace.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Cursed Artifacts</h2>
<p>Dangerous items that carry terrible prices for their power. Most are contained or destroyed when found.</p>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>The Whispering Blade</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Cursed dagger | <strong>Origin:</strong> Unknown | <strong>Current Status:</strong> Contained by Conclave of Wardens
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This plain iron dagger seems unremarkable until held, at which point the wielder begins to hear whispers. The voice is compelling, persuasive, and always suggests violence as the solution to any problem.</p>
<h4>Curse</h4>
<p>The Blade slowly corrupts its wielder, making them paranoid, violent, and ultimately homicidal. The whispers grow louder the longer the blade is held, eventually drowning out all other thought.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The Blade has appeared throughout history, always leaving a trail of murder. Each wielder eventually kills those closest to them before being killed themselves - at which point the blade vanishes, only to appear elsewhere.</p>
<h4>Containment</h4>
<p>The Conclave has contained the Blade in a lead-lined box inscribed with silencing runes. It remains in their deepest vault, watched constantly for any sign of escape.</p>
</div>

<h3>Medallion of False Life</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Cursed jewelry | <strong>Origin:</strong> Age of Silence | <strong>Current Status:</strong> Multiple copies exist
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These medallions appear as beautiful golden pendants bearing symbols of health and vitality. They promise eternal youth - and initially, they deliver.</p>
<h4>Curse</h4>
<p>The Medallion halts aging and heals injuries, but it does so by draining life from those around the wearer. Family members sicken. Friends waste away. The wearer remains healthy while everyone they love dies.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Created by a mage desperate to save his dying wife, the first Medallion killed their children within a year. The mage destroyed himself in grief, but his notes survived, and others have recreated the cursed items.</p>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>Anyone found wearing such a Medallion is assumed to be either a victim (in early stages) or a monster (in late stages). The Conclave offers substantial rewards for their destruction.</p>

<h3>The Hungry Book</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Cursed tome | <strong>Origin:</strong> Sunken City Library | <strong>Current Status:</strong> Unknown (escaped containment)
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This leather-bound book appears to contain valuable magical knowledge. Its pages are blank until read, at which point they fill with whatever information the reader most desires.</p>
<h4>Curse</h4>
<p>The Book feeds on memory. Each reading erases something from the reader's mind - at first small things, then larger ones. Eventually, readers forget their own names, their loved ones, their identities.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Recovered from the Sunken City, the Book was studied extensively before its nature was understood. Three scholars were reduced to mindless shells before the Conclave attempted to destroy it - unsuccessfully.</p>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>The Book escaped during transport and has not been recovered. It may appear as any tome, revealing its true nature only after it has begun feeding. Any book that seems too perfect, too helpful, should be viewed with suspicion.</p>

<h3>Ring of the Betrayer</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Cursed ring | <strong>Origin:</strong> First War | <strong>Current Status:</strong> Believed destroyed
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This simple gold band was created by a general who wished to ensure the loyalty of his officers. It bound the wearer to absolute obedience - and absolute suffering if that obedience wavered.</p>
<h4>Curse</h4>
<p>The Ring cannot be removed once worn. It compels obedience to whoever placed it on the wearer's finger, enforcing commands through intense pain. Death is the only escape.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The general used the Rings to control his command staff, creating an army of unwilling slaves. When the Treaty of Nortaq was signed, the Ring's enslaved officers were freed by destroying the master ring - killing the general in the process.</p>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>Notes on the Ring's creation survive. The Conclave works to suppress this knowledge, but copies may exist in private collections.</p>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>The Amber Prison</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Cursed gemstone | <strong>Origin:</strong> Ambers Call | <strong>Current Status:</strong> Lost in the ruins
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This fist-sized piece of amber seems to contain a tiny figure - because it does. The Prison can trap souls, holding them in eternal consciousness within the gem.</p>
<h4>Curse</h4>
<p>Those trapped in the Amber Prison do not die; they cannot die. They exist in perfect awareness, unable to move, speak, or act, for as long as the gem exists. Some have been trapped for centuries.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Created as a punishment for the worst criminals, the Prison was lost when Ambers Call fell. The Void-touched who overran the city may have found it - or it may lie buried in the ruins, its prisoners still aware, still waiting.</p>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>Freeing those trapped requires shattering the gem, which releases all imprisoned souls simultaneously. Given that some were imprisoned for very good reasons, this may not be advisable.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Mask of Many Faces</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Cursed disguise | <strong>Origin:</strong> Unknown | <strong>Current Status:</strong> In circulation
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This plain white mask allows its wearer to perfectly assume the appearance of anyone they have seen. The disguise is flawless, fooling even magical detection.</p>
<h4>Curse</h4>
<p>Each use of the Mask erases a piece of the wearer's original identity. After enough uses, the wearer forgets who they originally were - and the Mask becomes their true face, trapping them in whatever form they wore last.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The Mask has changed hands many times, each owner eventually losing themselves to it. Some victims have been found wandering, unable to remember their names, wearing faces that belonged to others.</p>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>The Mask always resurfaces after its current wearer is lost. It seems to seek out those who desperately want to be someone else - and grants their wish in the cruelest way possible.</p>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>The Seventh Seal</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Legendary ward | <strong>Last Known Location:</strong> Unknown | <strong>Sought By:</strong> Conclave of Wardens
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>When the Dragon Gods sealed Zelgor away, they created six seals - one for each of them. But legends speak of a seventh seal, created in secret, containing power equal to all six combined.</p>
<h4>Legend</h4>
<p>The Seventh Seal was supposedly hidden where the Void itself could not find it, to be used only if the other seals failed. Its location was entrusted to a single guardian whose identity has been lost to time.</p>
<h4>Significance</h4>
<p>If the Seventh Seal exists, it represents the ultimate failsafe against Zelgors return. Finding it could mean the difference between victory and annihilation in the final battle.</p>
<h4>Searches</h4>
<p>The Conclave has sought the Seventh Seal for centuries without success. Some believe it is merely legend; others that its guardian's descendants still protect it, waiting for the moment of greatest need.</p>

<h3>Crown of United Peoples</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Legendary symbol | <strong>Last Known Location:</strong> Destroyed during First War | <strong>Sought By:</strong> Diplomats, idealists
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Before the First War, the races of Aedelore created a crown representing their unity - a circlet bearing gems from each homeland, blessed by representatives of all peoples.</p>
<h4>Legend</h4>
<p>The Crown was said to grant its wearer the ability to speak with perfect understanding to any race and to command respect across all boundaries. It symbolized the cooperation that built Aedelore's greatest achievements.</p>
<h4>Significance</h4>
<p>The Crown was shattered during the First War, each race taking fragments as they retreated to their homelands. Reuniting the pieces is seen as a necessary step toward true lasting peace.</p>
<h4>Searches</h4>
<p>Several fragments have been recovered, but others remain lost. Some say the Crown cannot be remade until the peoples of Aedelore truly want unity - and that desire remains incomplete.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>The Ships of Elarion</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Void-crossing vessels | <strong>Last Known Location:</strong> Dismantled after the Crossing | <strong>Sought By:</strong> Scholars, explorers
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The twelve portal ships that carried the Elves from Elarion were marvels of magical engineering - vessels capable of traversing the Void itself. They were dismantled after arrival, their components distributed as relics.</p>
<h4>Legend</h4>
<p>Some believe that the ships could be rebuilt if their scattered components were gathered. A working portal ship could potentially reach other worlds - or return to Elarion to discover its final fate.</p>
<h4>Significance</h4>
<p>The ships represent the pinnacle of Elarion's magical achievement. Rebuilding even one would prove that such feats remain possible - and would open paths to realms beyond imagination.</p>
<h4>Searches</h4>
<p>The Arcane Creed maintains records of known ship components, but many were lost during the Age of Silence. Finding and authenticating pieces is painstaking work that has occupied scholars for generations.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>Heart of the Mountain</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Legendary gemstone | <strong>Last Known Location:</strong> Deep beneath Mount Basin | <strong>Sought By:</strong> Dwarven expeditions
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Heart is said to be a ruby the size of a Dwarf's torso, pulsing with inner light like a living heartbeat. It is the source of Mount Basin's volcanic heat and, some say, the source of the Dwarven race itself.</p>
<h4>Legend</h4>
<p>Tiamat placed the Heart at the center of the mountain when she shaped the Dwarves, giving it a piece of her own essence. Finding it would prove the Dwarves' divine origin beyond doubt.</p>
<h4>Significance</h4>
<p>The Heart supposedly grants whoever touches it a connection to Tiamat herself - understanding of the earth's deepest secrets and power over stone and metal beyond any mortal smith.</p>
<h4>Searches</h4>
<p>Many Dwarven expeditions have sought the Heart, delving ever deeper into Mount Basin. None have returned with proof of its existence - and some have not returned at all.</p>
</div>

<div class="artifact">
<h3>The Last Song of Elarion</h3>
<div class="artifact-meta">
<strong>Type:</strong> Musical composition | <strong>Last Known Location:</strong> Lost to memory | <strong>Sought By:</strong> Elven historians, bards
</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>As Elarion fell, its greatest bards composed a final song - a lament that captured the essence of everything being lost. Those who heard it were moved to tears; those who remember it say no other music has ever compared.</p>
<h4>Legend</h4>
<p>The Last Song was never written down, existing only in the memories of those who heard it. But memory fades, and the eldest Elves who crossed from Elarion grow fewer each century.</p>
<h4>Significance</h4>
<p>More than mere music, the Last Song is said to contain power - the concentrated grief and love of an entire civilization. Some believe that performing it perfectly could achieve miraculous effects.</p>
<h4>Searches</h4>
<p>Scholars have attempted to reconstruct the Song from fragmentary memories, but no version has captured its legendary power. Perhaps some things are meant to be lost; perhaps the Song waits for someone worthy to remember.</p>
