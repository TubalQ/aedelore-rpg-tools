<div class="entry">
<h3>Starbloom</h3>
<p class="meta">Classification: Celestial Flower | Habitat: High mountain peaks | Rarity: Very Rare | Magical Affinity: Divination, Light</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Know that upon the highest peaks, where mortal feet seldom tread and the air grows thin as whispered secrets, there blooms the Starbloom. Its petals shift through colors unknown to ordinary flowers - not merely blue or violet, but hues that exist between colors, shades that the eye struggles to name.</p>

<h4>Magical Properties</h4>
<p>The Starbloom serves as a conduit between the mortal realm and the celestial spheres. Mages who consume its nectar report visions of distant places and future events. The flower is essential in brewing potions of foresight and creating scrying implements.</p>

<h4>Harvesting Notes</h4>

</div>

<div class="entry">
<h3>Voidthorn</h3>
<p class="meta">Classification: Abyssal Plant | Habitat: Places touched by the Void | Rarity: Extremely Rare | Magical Affinity: Void Magic, Necromancy</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Where the Void has touched the world and left its mark, there sometimes grows the Voidthorn. Black as the space between stars, its thorns drip with liquid shadow. No natural light falls upon it - rather, it seems to drink illumination from its surroundings.</p>

<h4>Magical Properties</h4>
<p>Essential component in void magic rituals and certain necromantic preparations. The thorns, when powdered, allow temporary sight into the spaces between worlds. Extremely dangerous to handle without proper protections.</p>

<h4>Harvesting Notes</h4>

</div>

<div class="entry">

<p class="meta">Classification: Elemental Flower | Habitat: Volcanic regions and fire-touched lands | Rarity: Rare | Magical Affinity: Fire, Transmutation</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<h4>Magical Properties</h4>
<p>Primary ingredient in potions of fire resistance and fire-breathing elixirs. Enchanted weapons benefit from Flamelily essence, gaining properties of flame. The flower can also be used to create ever-burning torches.</p>

</div>

<div class="entry">

<p class="meta">Classification: Elemental Flower | Habitat: Eternal glaciers and frozen wastes | Rarity: Rare | Magical Affinity: Ice, Preservation</p>

<p>Used in creating potions of cold resistance and preservation magic. Items treated with Frostrose essence resist decay and aging. The flower is also essential for certain cryomantic rituals and the creation of ice elementals.</p>

<h4>Harvesting Notes</h4>
<p>Grows only at ley line intersections, which must be located through magical means. Harvest during magical high tides for maximum potency. The plant resists being transplanted - it simply withers away from its power source.</p>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<h3>Shadowmoss</h3>
<p class="meta">Classification: Dark Flora | Habitat: Places of permanent darkness | Rarity: Uncommon | Magical Affinity: Shadow, Illusion</p>

<p>Essential for invisibility potions and shadow magic rituals. Can be used to create areas of magical darkness or to enhance stealth enchantments. Some assassin guilds cultivate it for their own purposes.</p>

<p class="meta">Classification: Sacred Flower | Habitat: Holy places and temples of Elarion | Rarity: Very Rare | Magical Affinity: Healing, Life</p>

<h4>Harvesting Notes</h4>
<p>May only be gathered by those pure of heart - the flower withers at the touch of evil. Must be used fresh, as it loses potency rapidly after harvest. Never sells on the open market - temples guard their supplies jealously.</p>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<h3>Thundercap</h3>
<p class="meta">Classification: Elemental Fungus | Habitat: Storm-struck highlands | Rarity: Rare | Magical Affinity: Lightning, Storm</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This mushroom grows where lightning has struck, feeding on the residual electrical energy. Its cap crackles with contained static, and touching it produces a sharp shock. During storms, Thundercaps glow with inner light and release spores on the wind.</p>

<h4>Magical Properties</h4>
<p>Enhances mental abilities and psychic powers. Used in telepathy rituals, memory manipulation, and mental defense preparations. Can also be used to create potions that temporarily boost intelligence or grant limited mind-reading.</p>

<h4>Harvesting Notes</h4>
<p>The plant reads minds - approach with mental shields active. Harvest only what is needed, as taking too much angers the plant and attracts psychic predators. Those without mental training should avoid direct contact.</p>
</div>
