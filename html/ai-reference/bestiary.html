<h2>Void Creatures</h2>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Shadow Stalker</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Void-spawned predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Areas where the Boundary is thin, ruins, deep caves<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Shadow Stalkers exist in the space between shadows, emerging only to feed on the life force of living creatures. They appear as darker patches within darkness itself-a shadow that moves against the light, that reaches when it should retreat.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>These creatures are patient hunters. They will follow prey for days, waiting for the moment when their target is alone, tired, or distracted. They do not kill for sustenance in the traditional sense-they drain vitality, leaving victims weakened, aged, or simply... absent. Bodies are rarely found.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Shadow Stalkers are vulnerable to direct light, particularly fire consecrated to Taninsam. They cannot manifest in brightly lit areas and will flee from sudden illumination. In darkness, however, they are nearly impossible to detect until they strike.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>For it is written: the Shadow Stalker is not truly alive, for it was never born. It is hunger given form, a fragment of the Voids eternal appetite that has learned to hunt. Where one appears, others often follow-drawn by the weakening of reality that their presence causes.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Void Wraith</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Consumed soul<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Sites of mass death, corrupted temples, the Sunken City<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Void Wraiths are the echoes of souls that were not merely killed but entirely consumed by the Void. Unlike ghosts, which retain some connection to their former lives, Wraiths remember nothing of what they once were. They exist only to serve the darkness that unmade them.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wraiths serve as scouts and heralds for greater Void entities. They drift through the world seeking cracks in the Boundary, potential hosts for corruption, or simply spreading despair through their mere presence. Those who see a Wraith often report overwhelming feelings of hopelessness and the certainty that all effort is futile.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Physical weapons pass through Void Wraiths harmlessly. Only magic, blessed weapons, or sacred flames can harm them. Their touch drains warmth and hope-prolonged contact can leave permanent psychological scars.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The Conclave of Wardens believes that Wraiths can be released through specific rituals of purification, freeing whatever fragment of the original soul remains. However, such rituals are dangerous and rarely attempted.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Entropy Weaver</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Reality-dissolving entity<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Tears in the Boundary, ruins of Ambers Call<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Entropy Weavers are among the most dangerous Void entities that can manifest in Aedelore. They exist to unmake-dissolving matter and magic alike into raw nothingness. Where they pass, reality itself grows thin, creating permanent weak points in the Boundary.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Unlike predatory Void creatures, Entropy Weavers do not hunt. They simply move, and everything they touch ceases to exist. They are drawn to concentrations of magic and life, perhaps because these represent the antithesis of the Void they serve.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Direct engagement with an Entropy Weaver is suicide. The only effective strategy is containment-using wards to redirect its path away from populated areas until it eventually dissipates or returns to the Void. The Arcane Creed maintains protocols for such containment, but even these are not always successful.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>It is believed that Entropy Weavers are not sent by the Void but simply emerge when the Boundary weakens sufficiently. They are symptoms of corruption rather than its agents-a sign that reality itself is beginning to fail.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Whisper Fiend</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Corruptor<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Near sleeping mortals, places of despair<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate (individually), Extreme (long-term)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Whisper Fiends are small, nearly invisible entities that specialize in corruption rather than direct harm. They appear as distortions in the air, barely perceptible movements at the edge of vision, voices that seem to come from inside ones own head.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>These creatures attach themselves to vulnerable mortals-those grieving, despairing, or simply exhausted-and begin their work. They whisper doubts, suspicions, and dark thoughts, so subtly that victims believe these thoughts are their own. Over time, the whispers grow louder, more insistent, until the victim begins to act on them.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Whisper Fiends flee from direct confrontation. They can be driven off temporarily by loud noise, bright light, or the presence of multiple alert individuals. Permanent removal requires identifying the fiends anchor point-usually an object or location associated with the victims trauma-and purifying it.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The tragedy of Whisper Fiends is that their victims often do not realize they are being influenced until it is too late. Many acts of inexplicable cruelty, betrayal, or despair have been traced to these insidious entities.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Void Maw</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Void beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deep caves, abandoned mines, the depths of Ambers Call<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The Void Maw is a massive, worm-like creature that burrows through earth and stone, leaving tunnels of corrupted matter in its wake. Its body is a cylinder of absolute darkness, and where its head should be is only a circular opening-a maw that consumes everything it touches.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Void Maws are drawn to sources of life and heat beneath the earth. They have devastated Dwarven mining operations and are believed to be responsible for several tunnel collapses that were initially blamed on natural causes. They do not seem intelligent in any meaningful sense-they simply consume.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The hide of a Void Maw is resistant to conventional weapons. Fire and light-based magic can harm them, but their size makes them difficult to kill quickly. The safest approach is to collapse their tunnel and seal them in, though this does not kill them-merely contains them.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Some scholars believe Void Maws are what remains when an Entropy Weaver partially fails to return to the Void-a fragment of unmaking that has taken on a more stable, if no less dangerous, form.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Hollow One</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void-Corrupted<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Former settlements consumed by void<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Once mortal, Hollow Ones are what remains when the void consumes a person soul but leaves the body animated. They appear as normal people until you see their eyes - empty pits of absolute nothing that draw in light.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Hollow Ones mimic their former lives, going through motions of existence. They try to fill their emptiness by consuming the essence of others, drawn especially to those who knew them in life.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesPhysically fragile but their touch drains vitality. Holy water and light magic effective. Destroying them releases trapped void energy - maintain distance. Sometimes show flickers of former personality that can be exploited.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Formless Terror</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Unformed Void matter<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Tears in the Boundary<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate (individually), Extreme (in numbers)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Formless Terrors are masses of pure Void-stuff that have not yet coalesced into specific shapes. They appear as roiling clouds of darkness, constantly shifting, occasionally forming eyes or mouths that dissolve as quickly as they appear.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>These creatures are driven purely by instinct-the Voids hunger translated into mindless action. They flow toward life like water toward low ground, engulfing and consuming anything organic they encounter. They are most dangerous in numbers, where they can overwhelm defenders through sheer volume.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Formless Terrors are vulnerable to all forms of light and fire. Even torchlight causes them to recoil. They can be destroyed by sustained magical assault, but the true danger is that killing one often attracts others. Where the Boundary is weak enough for Formless Terrors to emerge, there are always more waiting.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Some theorize that all Void creatures begin as Formless Terrors, slowly developing into more specialized forms as they feed and grow. If true, every Terror destroyed is a future nightmare prevented.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Voidling Swarm</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Lesser Void spawn<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Near thin points in the Boundary<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low (individually), High (as swarm)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Voidlings are the smallest manifestations of the Void-tiny, skittering things no larger than a hand, appearing as small patches of animate darkness. Individually, they are nearly harmless. In swarms of hundreds or thousands, they can strip flesh from bone in moments.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Voidlings function as a collective, moving and attacking in coordination without any apparent communication. They are drawn to warmth and will infiltrate buildings through the smallest cracks, emerging at night to feed. Their presence often indicates a nearby weakness in the Boundary.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Fire is the most effective weapon against Voidling swarms-even mundane fire will cause them to scatter. Area-effect magic can eliminate large numbers at once. The challenge is preventing their escape, as survivors will inevitably return with more of their kind.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Farmers and villagers in remote areas have developed various folk remedies against Voidlings, from lines of salt to hanging iron charms. The effectiveness of these methods varies, but the Voidlings clear reluctance to cross certain thresholds suggests they have some basis in truth.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Abyssal Watcher</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Void observer<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> High places, watchtowers, anywhere with clear sightlines<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low (directly), High (strategically)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Abyssal Watchers are stationary Void entities that manifest as floating spheres of darkness, each containing a single, unblinking eye. They do not attack, do not feed, do not corrupt-they simply observe, transmitting what they see back to the greater consciousness of the Void.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Watchers appear in locations that offer broad views of populated areas. They remain in place for days or weeks, observing patterns of movement, defenses, and daily routines. Their presence often precedes a more significant Void incursion, suggesting they serve a scouting function.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Watchers will flee if approached aggressively, dissolving into shadow and reforming elsewhere. They can be destroyed by concentrated magical attack, but this often proves futile-another Watcher will simply appear to take its place. The Conclave recommends monitoring Watchers rather than destroying them, as their behavior can reveal Void intentions.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>There is debate about whether Watchers are independent entities or extensions of a single vast intelligence. If the latter, every Watcher destroyed teaches the Void something about mortal defenses.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Corrupted One</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Void-twisted beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Varies based on original creature<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Variable<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Corrupted Ones are ordinary animals that have been twisted by prolonged Void exposure. Their forms become distorted-extra limbs, eyes in wrong places, bodies that bend in impossible ways. Their behavior becomes aggressive, predatory, and seemingly driven by malice rather than instinct.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Unlike other Void creatures, Corrupted Ones retain some memory of their original nature. A corrupted wolf still hunts in packs; a corrupted bear still defends territory. But these behaviors are twisted toward cruelty-they kill not for food but seemingly for pleasure, and they target intelligent prey over easier alternatives.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Corrupted Ones are tougher and more aggressive than their uncorrupted counterparts, but they remain vulnerable to the same weapons. Fire and blessed weapons are more effective than normal. The true danger is their unpredictability-corruption seems to grant them an unsettling cunning.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The sight of a Corrupted One often causes more psychological damage than physical. To see a creature that was once natural twisted into something hateful reminds observers of what the Void truly wants: not destruction, but perversion-the corruption of everything good into something terrible.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Void Leech</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Parasite<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Void rifts and corrupted areas<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These writhing, eyeless worms of pure darkness attach themselves to living creatures, draining not blood but life essence itself. They range from finger-length to arm-length, always seeking warmth and vitality to consume.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Void Leeches sense life force and move toward it relentlessly. They burrow through clothing and armor to reach flesh. A single leech weakens; a swarm kills within minutes as they drain the victim soul.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesLight magic burns them instantly. Fire works but risks the host. Salt creates barriers they cannot cross. Remove carefully - tearing them off causes additional soul damage.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Nullbeast</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deep void rifts<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Where reality itself frays, Nullbeasts emerge - massive quadrupeds that seem carved from solidified nothingness. Looking upon them causes vertigo as the mind struggles to process their non-existence. They leave voids in reality where they walk.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Nullbeasts hunt by erasing. Anything they touch simply ceases to exist - not destroyed, but removed from reality entirely. They are drawn to strong magical emanations and seem to find mages particularly appetizing.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesDo not engage. Flee immediately. Only the most powerful reality-anchoring magic provides any defense. Their very presence weakens the fabric of existence.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Whisper Wraith</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Void-touched ruins<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These ethereal entities manifest as shifting shadows that constantly murmur in languages no mortal knows. They drift through walls and flesh alike, leaving cold emptiness in their wake. Their touch does not wound the body but the mind.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Whisper Wraiths seek out the lonely and vulnerable, tormenting them with maddening whispers before draining their sanity. They collect memories and emotions, leaving hollow shells behind.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesPhysical weapons useless. Magic of light or order damages them. Strong mental fortitude resists their whispers. Never face alone - isolation strengthens them.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Entropy Moth</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Insect<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Areas of decay and ruin<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low (swarms Dangerous)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Beautiful in a terrible way, Entropy Moths bear wings of swirling darkness that scatter reality-dust wherever they fly. Each moth is small, but they gather in vast clouds that accelerate decay and aging in everything they touch.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Drawn to anything ancient or dying. Their presence hastens the end of all things - wood rots, metal rusts, flesh withers. They seem to feed on the concept of ending itself.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesIndividual moths easily crushed but swarms overwhelming. Preservation magic repels them. Fire disperses but doesn not kill. Avoid breathing their dust - it ages lungs rapidly.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Rift Hound</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Between dimensions<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These hunting beasts of the void resemble wolves made of fractured space, their forms constantly shifting as if seen through broken glass. They phase between realities, appearing and disappearing at will during their hunts.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Rift Hounds hunt in packs, using dimensional shifting to flank and overwhelm prey. They track across dimensional boundaries - escaping to another plane merely delays them. Once they have a scent, they never stop hunting.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesDimensional anchor magic prevents their phasing. Strike during the moment they materialize to attack. Silver disrupts their form temporarily. Killing the pack alpha causes others to flee.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Void Kraken</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Leviathan<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ocean void rifts<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Catastrophic<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>In the deepest trenches where sunlight has never reached, void rifts open beneath the waves. From these tears in reality emerge the Void Krakens - tentacled horrors that dwarf the largest ships, their bodies composed of liquid darkness and hungry nothing.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Void Krakens surface to feed on ships, crews, and coastal settlements. They drag prey into the depths where the void consumes them utterly. Fortunately rare, but sightings increase when the void grows strong.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesNaval engagement suicidal. Flee for shallow waters they cannot enter. Concentrated light magic from multiple casters may drive them back. Ancient sea-ward stones offer some protection to harbors.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Gloom Spider</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Arachnid<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Dark corners and void-touched caves<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These spiders spin webs of solidified darkness that ensnare both body and soul. Ranging from hand-sized to horse-sized, they lurk in shadows waiting for prey. Their bite injects void venom that paralyzes while keeping victims conscious.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Gloom Spiders wrap prey in shadow-silk and feed slowly over days. They prefer to keep victims alive as long as possible, savoring their fear. Multiple spiders may share territory and prey.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesShadow webs dissolve in direct light. Fire effective against both spider and web. Their eyes are vulnerable - blind them and they become confused. Antivenom exists but is rare and expensive.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Reality Bleeder</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Anomaly<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Unstable magical areas<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Not truly creatures but wounds in reality given motion, Reality Bleeders appear as floating tears in space that seep darkness. They move with alien purpose, and where they pass, the world bleeds away into void.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Reality Bleeders drift toward concentrations of magical energy or strong emotions. They seem to feed on existence itself, growing larger as they consume more reality. Eventually they either dissipate or become permanent rifts.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesCannot be fought conventionally. Reality-anchoring rituals can seal them. Avoid all contact - anything that touches them is partially erased. Mages report severe headaches in their presence.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Shade Stalker</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Void Assassin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Shadows everywhere<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Elite predators of the void, Shade Stalkers are humanoid shadows with elongated limbs and claws of crystallized darkness. They can fold themselves into any shadow, traveling instantly between patches of darkness.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Shade Stalkers are patient hunters, observing targets for days before striking. They prefer to kill silently, dragging bodies into shadow where they feed undisturbed. Some serve greater void powers as assassins.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesEliminate all shadows in the area before engaging. Magical light that cannot be extinguished is essential. They retreat from overwhelming illumination. Cold iron weapons cause them pain.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Undead</h2>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Draugr</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Animated corpse<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ancient tombs, barrows, battlefields<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Draugr are corpses that have risen from death, animated by rage, regret, or dark magic. Unlike mindless zombies, Draugr retain fragments of their former intelligence and often guard the places where they died with single-minded determination.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Most Draugr are bound to specific locations-their tomb, their home, or the site of their death. They will not pursue intruders beyond these boundaries but will attack anything that enters with terrible ferocity. Some Draugr can speak, though their words are usually threats or laments.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Draugr are stronger than they were in life and feel no pain. They can be destroyed by dismemberment, fire, or blessed weapons. Silver is particularly effective. They are vulnerable to sunlight, which forces them to retreat to darkness.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The faithful of Tatsu consider Draugr a tragedy-souls that refused to accept his guidance and now exist in a tortured half-state. Proper funeral rites prevent Draugr rising; their existence often indicates disturbed graves or deaths so violent that the soul could not find peace.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Skeletal Warrior</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Animated skeleton<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Battlefields, crypts, sites of mass death<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low to Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Skeletal Warriors are the animated remains of fallen soldiers, stripped of flesh but still capable of wielding the weapons they carried in life. They move with an unsettling precision, their empty eye sockets somehow tracking living prey.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Unlike Draugr, Skeletal Warriors have no individual will. They follow the commands of whoever raised them or, lacking a master, simply attack the living on sight. They fight with whatever tactics they knew in life, making well-trained warriors more dangerous even in death.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Skeletal Warriors are fragile compared to Draugr-a solid blow can shatter bones. However, they feel no fear and will not retreat. Bludgeoning weapons are most effective; edged weapons often pass between bones without doing significant damage.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The creation of Skeletal Warriors is forbidden by every major religion, as it denies the dead the rest they are owed. Necromancers who raise such forces are hunted by the Conclave of Wardens and the faithful of Tatsu alike.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Wraith</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Vengeful spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Sites of murder, betrayal, or great injustice<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Wraiths are the spirits of those who died with such overwhelming hatred or grief that they refused Tatsus call. They appear as translucent, twisted versions of their living forms, their faces frozen in expressions of rage or anguish.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wraiths are driven by a single overriding purpose-usually vengeance against whoever wronged them in life. They will destroy anyone who stands between them and their target, but they have no interest in random violence. Some Wraiths have pursued their prey for centuries.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Physical weapons pass through Wraiths without effect. Only magic, blessed weapons, or weapons made of silver can harm them. Their touch drains life force, and prolonged contact can be fatal. Sunlight weakens them significantly.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>A Wraith can only find rest when its purpose is fulfilled or when the injustice that created it is somehow addressed. Some heroes have found ways to give Wraiths peace without fulfilling their murderous intentions-but such solutions require understanding what the Wraith truly needs, which is rarely what it claims to want.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Bone Colossus</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Constructed Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Mass graves, battlefields<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>When a necromancer of great power draws upon a battlefield or mass grave, the bones of hundreds may fuse into a single towering horror - the Bone Colossus. Standing thirty feet or more, these skeletal giants are siege weapons given unholy life.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Bone Colossi follow their creator commands without question. They lack the intelligence for independent action but execute orders with terrifying efficiency. Without commands, they simply destroy anything living nearby.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTarget the binding runes usually inscribed on the skull or spine. Destroying enough bones eventually collapses the structure. Holy magic disrupts the animating force. Requires coordinated group effort.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Ghost</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Lingering spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Anywhere with strong emotional residue<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low to Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Ghosts are the spirits of the dead who remain in the mortal world due to unfinished business, strong emotional attachment, or simple confusion. Unlike Wraiths, most Ghosts are not malevolent-merely lost, sad, or unable to accept their deaths.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Most Ghosts are harmless, appearing briefly to loved ones or replaying moments from their lives in endless loops. Some are aware of the living and can communicate; others seem oblivious, trapped in memories that no longer correspond to reality.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Hostile Ghosts are rare but dangerous. They can possess the weak-willed, create terrifying illusions, or drain life energy through touch. However, most Ghosts can be dealt with through negotiation, helping them complete their unfinished business, or performing proper funeral rites.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The faithful of Tatsu view Ghosts with compassion rather than fear. Each Ghost represents a soul that needs help finding its way-and helping a Ghost pass on is considered a sacred duty.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Banshee</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Spectral Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Violent death of those with great sorrow<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Born from grief and violent death, Banshees manifest as wailing spirits of women whose anguish transcended death itself. Their appearance varies from hauntingly beautiful to horrifically decayed, often shifting between states.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Banshees are drawn to those about to die, their wail heralding coming death. Some actively cause the deaths they foresee. They haunt places connected to their mortal sorrows, unable to move on.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir wail can kill instantly - ear protection essential but not fully effective. Incorporeal, requiring magic to harm. Resolving their mortal grief can lay them to rest peacefully.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Revenant</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Returned warrior<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Pursuing their killers<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Revenants are warriors who have returned from death with a singular purpose: to destroy those who killed them. Unlike other undead, Revenants retain their full intelligence, skills, and memories. They appear as they did in life, though closer inspection reveals the wounds that killed them.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>A Revenant will pursue its target across any distance, through any obstacle, for as long as it takes. It cannot be bargained with, cannot be deterred, cannot be distracted. It exists only to kill, and once its purpose is fulfilled, it returns to death peacefully.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Revenants fight with the skill they possessed in life, making experienced warriors particularly dangerous. They can be destroyed through combat, but they will reform within days unless their killer is slain. Only fulfilling their vengeance-or destroying the killer by other means-ends their existence permanently.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Revenants are rare because they require a specific combination of circumstances: a skilled warrior, killed unjustly, with the will to return. The faithful of Tatsu view them as exceptions to the natural order-souls so wronged that even the god of death granted them time to seek justice.</div>

<h3>Wight</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Greater Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Those who died with great hatred or ambition<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Wights are undead driven by the dark emotions that consumed them in life. Unlike mindless zombies, they retain cunning intelligence and their killing touch drains life force, potentially creating new wights from victims.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wights often haunt places connected to their mortal obsessions - tombs of rivals, sites of betrayal, treasures they coveted. They kill not for sustenance but from malice, building small armies of spawn.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir touch drains life - avoid melee if possible. Silver and magic weapons most effective. Sunlight weakens but does not destroy them. Kill quickly before they create more of their kind.</div>

<h3>Plague Bearer</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Corrupted Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Plague victims denied proper burial<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous (Catastrophic in groups)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Those who died of plague and were denied proper burial rites may rise as Plague Bearers - rotting corpses that spread the diseases that killed them. Swollen with pestilence, they shamble forth seeking to share their suffering.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Plague Bearers instinctively seek populated areas. They feel compelled to spread infection through touch, bite, or simply proximity. Where one appears, epidemics follow unless contained immediately.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesFire is essential - destroy corpses completely. Maintain distance and use ranged attacks. Protective masks and wards against disease mandatory. Quarantine any who make contact.</div>

<h3>Death Knight</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Elite Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Fallen paladins and great warriors<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>When warriors of great prowess fall to darkness or are raised by powerful necromancy, they may become Death Knights - undead champions retaining all their martial skill plus unholy power. They command lesser undead and wield cursed weapons.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Death Knights retain their intelligence and personality, twisted by undeath. Some serve dark masters; others pursue their own agendas. They often gather undead armies, seeking to conquer in death what they could not in life.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesExpect martial expertise exceeding most living warriors. Their weapons carry death curses. They regenerate unless destroyed by holy power. Exploit their living memories and sense of honor.</div>

<h3>Crawling Claw</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Minor Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Severed hands animated by dark magic<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low (swarms Moderate)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Severed hands given terrible unlife, Crawling Claws scuttle on their fingers like grotesque spiders. Individually weak, they attack in numbers, overwhelming victims through sheer quantity. Necromancers use them as guards and scouts.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Crawling Claws follow simple commands - guard, attack, fetch. They retain some memory of their former owners, sometimes displaying familiar gestures. Without direction, they seek out the living to strangle.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesEasily destroyed individually but dangerous in numbers. They go for the throat. Stomping effective. Fire cleanses them permanently. Check for hidden ones before resting in infested areas.</div>

<h3>Corpse Golem</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Constructed Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Necromantic creation from multiple corpses<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Stitched together from multiple corpses and animated through dark ritual, Corpse Golems are massive brutes of rotting flesh. They combine the strength of many bodies into one lumbering horror that feels no pain and never tires.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Corpse Golems follow their creator commands literally. They lack creativity but make excellent guards and laborers. When their creator dies, they typically continue their last orders until destroyed.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesImmense strength - avoid grappling. Resistant to most damage due to redundant organs. Fire and acid most effective. Severing limbs merely inconveniences them. Destroy the brain-housing head if identifiable.</div>

<h3>Wraith Lord</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Greater Spectral Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Powerful souls consumed by darkness<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The mightiest of incorporeal undead, Wraith Lords were once beings of great power whose souls became so steeped in darkness they transcended normal undeath. They command lesser spirits and can corrupt the living with a touch.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wraith Lords build courts of lesser undead, ruling shadow domains that mirror the living world. They seek to expand their influence, converting the living into spectral servants. Some remember their mortal goals and pursue them eternally.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesPowerful magic weapons required to even harm them. They can possess the weak-willed. Sunlight causes pain but they can endure it. Only complete destruction of their anchor object truly ends them.</div>

<h3>Boneclaw</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Failed Transformation Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Failed lich transformations<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>When a would-be lich fails their transformation ritual, the result is often a Boneclaw - a skeletal horror with elongated limbs ending in razor claws. Standing ten feet tall with arms reaching twice that, they are slaves to whoever was nearest during their failed ascension.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Boneclaws are psychically bound to a living master, often without that person knowledge. They lurk in shadows, emerging to protect or serve their unknowing bond-holder. They take cruel pleasure in killing.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir claws extend supernaturally far and slice through armor. They can teleport between shadows. Finding and eliminating their living bond-holder weakens them significantly. Holy magic effective.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Mohrg</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Criminal Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Mass murderers and serial killers<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Those who killed many in life sometimes rise as Mohrgs - skeletal undead with entrails hanging from their ribcage and a long, paralyzing tongue. Their victims rise as zombies under the Mohrg control.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Mohrgs continue their killing ways in death, building small armies of zombie victims. They prefer stalking and ambush, using their living memories of murder techniques. They seem to enjoy the kill as much as the result.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir tongue paralyzes - keep them at distance. Move quickly before they amass zombie hordes. They retain intelligence and may set traps. Holy ground prevents them from raising victims.</div>

<h3>Skeletal Mage</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Spellcasting Undead<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Wizards raised or transformed after death<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous to Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>When mages die and rise as undead, they may retain their spellcasting abilities. Skeletal Mages vary wildly in power depending on their abilities in life, but all combine the durability of undeath with dangerous magical capability.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Skeletal Mages often continue research begun in life, unconstrained by mortality. They may serve necromancers or pursue independent goals. Many become obsessed with achieving lichdom to preserve their minds forever.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesExpect varied magical attacks. Disrupt their spellcasting with quick strikes. They often have contingency spells and phylacteries. Anti-magic measures highly recommended.</div>

<h3>Ghast</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Greater Ghoul<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br>: Evolved ghouls or cursed cannibals<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Larger and more cunning than common ghouls, Ghasts exude a stench of death so potent it sickens the living. They lead packs of lesser ghouls and retain enough intelligence to set ambushes and use simple tactics.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Ghasts organize ghoul packs for more effective hunting. They claim territories in graveyards and crypts, emerging at night to raid nearby settlements. Some remember enough of life to speak and bargain.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir stench causes nausea - prepare accordingly. Paralyzing touch like ghouls but stronger. Fire and holy magic most effective. Killing the Ghast often scatters its ghoul followers.</div>

<h3>Dire Wolf</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Giant predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Northern forests, mountain passes<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Dire Wolves are massive versions of common wolves, standing as tall as a horse at the shoulder. Their fur ranges from silver-gray to pure black, and their yellow eyes gleam with predatory intelligence.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dire Wolves hunt in packs, using sophisticated tactics to bring down prey much larger than themselves. They are fiercely territorial and will defend their hunting grounds against all intruders, including other predators and armed travelers.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>A single Dire Wolf is dangerous; a pack is deadly. They coordinate their attacks, with some members distracting prey while others strike from behind. They are vulnerable to fire and will usually retreat if their pack takes significant casualties.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The Groove Guardian considers Dire Wolves sacred hunters, essential to maintaining the balance of forest ecosystems. Killing a Dire Wolf without necessity is considered a transgression against nature, though defending oneself is always justified.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Cave Bear</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Giant predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountain caves, deep forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Cave Bears are enormous ursines, nearly twice the size of common bears. Their thick fur is typically dark brown or black, and their claws can be as long as daggers. Despite their size, they move with surprising speed when provoked.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Cave Bears are solitary and territorial. They spend most of their lives in or near their cave lairs, emerging to hunt or forage. They are not naturally aggressive toward humanoids but will attack if surprised, cornered, or if their cubs are threatened.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>A Cave Bear is one of the most dangerous natural creatures in Aedelore. Their thick hide turns aside all but the heaviest weapons, and a single swipe of their claws can disembowel an armored warrior. The safest strategy is avoidance; if combat is unavoidable, multiple attackers focusing on the same target are essential.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Dwarves have a particular respect for Cave Bears, seeing in them a reflection of their own stubbornness and strength. Some Dwarven clans consider killing a Cave Bear a rite of passage, while others view them as sacred guardians of the deep places.</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Thunder Elk</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Magical beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Storm-touched highlands, mountain meadows<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Thunder Elk are majestic creatures with crackling energy running through their enormous antlers. During storms, they can be seen standing on hilltops, antlers raised to the sky, seemingly drawing power from the lightning itself.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Thunder Elk are generally peaceful grazers, but during mating season or when threatened, they become extremely aggressive. Their charge is accompanied by actual thunder, and their antlers can discharge electrical energy on contact.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Thunder Elk attack with charges and antler strikes that carry electrical damage. Metal armor provides less protection than usual, as the electricity conducts through it. Grounding oneself or using rubber-soled boots (if available) reduces the danger significantly.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The faithful of Leviathan consider Thunder Elk blessed by the Lord of Storms. Killing one without dire need is said to bring bad weather-and given Leviathans temperament, this may be more than superstition.</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Shadowcat</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Stealth predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Dense forests, jungle edges<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Shadowcats are large felines with fur so dark it seems to absorb light. They are nearly invisible in shadows and possess an uncanny ability to move without making sound. Only their eyes-reflecting light like twin moons-give them away.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Shadowcats are ambush predators, preferring to strike from concealment rather than chase prey. They are solitary and territorial, with each cat claiming several square miles of hunting ground. They rarely attack humanoids unless desperate or defending kittens.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Spotting a Shadowcat before it strikes is the primary challenge. They attack from behind, aiming for the neck. Once revealed, they are dangerous but not invincible-comparable to a large tiger. Bright light sources can prevent them from approaching undetected.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Elves have a special relationship with Shadowcats, and some rangers of Rivermount have formed bonds with these creatures. A bonded Shadowcat will serve as a loyal companion, though such bonds take years to form and require the cats willing participation.</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Giant Spider</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Arachnid predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Caves, ruins, dense forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate to High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Giant Spiders range from dog-sized to as large as horses, depending on the species and age. Their webs can span entire cavern halls, and their venom varies from paralytic to instantly lethal.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Giant Spiders are ambush predators that use their webs to trap prey. Most species are solitary, though some form colonies with complex social structures. They are not intelligent in the conventional sense but display cunning in their hunting strategies.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The primary dangers are webbing and venom. Characters caught in webs must cut themselves free while the spider approaches. Fire is effective both for destroying webs and harming the spiders themselves. Antivenom is advisable for anyone venturing into spider territory.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Giant Spider silk is highly prized by weavers and armorers-its stronger than steel wire and lighter than cloth. Harvesting it is dangerous work, typically done by specialists who have learned to navigate spider territories without triggering attacks.</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Boar, Wild</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Aggressive herbivore<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forests, scrubland<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low to Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Wild Boars in Aedelore grow larger than their counterparts in other worlds, with tusks that can gore through leather armor. Their coarse fur ranges from brown to black, and their small eyes burn with constant aggression.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wild Boars are notoriously ill-tempered, charging at perceived threats with little provocation. They travel in groups called sounders, and a charging sounder can trample anything in its path. They are most dangerous during mating season.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The primary danger is the charge-boars build up tremendous momentum and their tusks can inflict serious wounds. Sidestepping and letting the boar pass is safer than meeting it head-on. Spears and other reach weapons are effective if braced against the charge.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Boar hunting is a traditional test of courage in human lands. Many noble families display boar imagery on their crests, and a successful hunt is considered proof of martial prowess.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Wyvern</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Winged predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountain peaks, coastal cliffs<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Wyverns are large, two-legged flying reptiles with powerful wings and venomous tail stingers. Though often confused with true dragons, they lack front limbs, breath weapons, and the intelligence that defines dragonkind.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wyverns are territorial and aggressive, attacking anything that enters their hunting grounds. They prefer to strike from above, using their talons to grab prey and their tail stingers to inject paralyzing venom. They are smart enough to recognize armed groups as dangerous and may wait for stragglers.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Fighting a Wyvern requires ranged weapons or the ability to ground it. Once grounded, they are still dangerous but manageable for a prepared group. The tail sting should be avoided at all costs-the venom causes rapid paralysis followed by death if not treated.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Despite their danger, Wyverns can be domesticated if captured young. The Elves of Rivermount maintain a small force of Wyvern riders, though training one takes decades and bonding requires magical assistance.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Frost Wyrm</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Ice serpent<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Borea, frozen mountain peaks<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Frost Wyrms are enormous serpentine creatures native to the coldest regions of Aedelore. Their scales shimmer with frost, and their breath can flash-freeze anything it touches. They move through snow as easily as fish through water.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Frost Wyrms are ambush predators, hiding beneath the snow until prey passes overhead. They are most active during blizzards, when their movements are concealed by the storm. They hibernate during warmer months, awakening only when temperatures drop sufficiently.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Fire magic is essential when fighting Frost Wyrms-their scales resist physical damage but are vulnerable to heat. Their freezing breath requires constant movement to avoid. In groups, coordinated fire attacks can drive them away without a prolonged fight.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The Frost Wardens of Borea have developed techniques for coexisting with Frost Wyrms, marking their territories and avoiding them during active seasons. Complete eradication has been attempted and failed-the wyrms always return.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Basilisk</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Magical reptile<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ruins, deep caves<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Basilisks are eight-legged reptiles with the dreaded ability to petrify living creatures with their gaze. They are typically the size of large dogs, with scales that shift between green and gray and eyes that glow with malevolent golden light.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Basilisks are territorial predators, claiming abandoned structures or cave systems as their lairs. Their petrification ability means they rarely go hungry-victims remain preserved until the basilisk is ready to eat. They are not aggressive beyond their territory but will pursue intruders relentlessly.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The cardinal rule of basilisk combat: never meet their gaze. Mirrors can reflect their petrifying stare back at them, and fighting with averted eyes-while difficult-is possible for trained warriors. Killing the basilisk restores recently petrified victims; those left too long are lost forever.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Basilisk eyes retain their power even after death and are highly valued by alchemists and dark mages. This has led to a dangerous trade in basilisk parts, with hunters risking petrification for substantial rewards.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Manticore</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Chimeric predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Wastelands, badlands<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Manticores are terrifying chimeras with the body of a lion, bat-like wings, and a tail tipped with venomous spikes that can be launched like projectiles. Their faces are disturbingly humanoid, capable of crude speech and cruel laughter.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Manticores are intelligent and sadistic, often toying with prey before killing it. They delight in causing fear and will sometimes demand tribute from settlements rather than attacking directly. Their ability to speak makes them more dangerous-they can lie, negotiate, and betray.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Manticores attack from the air, launching tail spikes before closing for melee. The spikes carry paralytic venom that makes victims easy prey. Grounding a Manticore requires ranged weapons or magic; once grounded, they are still formidable but can be overwhelmed by numbers.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The origin of Manticores is unknown. Some believe they are the result of ancient magical experiments; others claim they emerged from the Void itself. Their intelligence and cruelty suggest something unnatural in their creation.</div>

<h3>Razorback Boar</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Megafauna<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Dense forests and swamps<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Know that the Razorback differs from its common cousin as thunder differs from whisper. Standing tall as a war horse at the shoulder, this massive boar bears tusks like curved swords and a ridge of bone-hard spines along its back. Its hide turns aside all but the sharpest blades.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Fiercely territorial and utterly fearless. The Razorback charges any perceived threat without hesitation, and few creatures survive the impact. They root through forests leaving destruction in their wake, and their wallows become hazardous bogs.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesThe charge is lethal - avoid at all costs. Flanking attacks may find softer hide near the belly. Fire causes panic but also berserk rage. Hunt only in large, well-coordinated groups.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Thornback Lion</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Savannas and dry forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>This apex predator earned its name from the ridge of thorn-like bone protrusions running from skull to tail. Larger than common lions, the Thornback possesses intelligence that borders on cunning. Its tawny hide bears darker stripes that provide excellent camouflage.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Unlike common lions, Thornbacks hunt alone or in mated pairs. They stalk prey for hours before striking. Known to hold grudges against those who escape or wound them, pursuing such individuals across great distances.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesThe thorns inject mild paralytic venom - avoid grappling. Exceptional leapers capable of clearing twenty feet. Sensitive hearing makes stealth approaches difficult. Best confronted from elevated positions.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Ironhide Rhinox</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Megafauna<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Plains and scrubland<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Armored as if by nature own smiths, the Ironhide Rhinox bears plates of bone-fused hide that deflect sword and arrow alike. Three horns crown its massive head, and its bulk rivals that of elephants. Despite appearances, it can achieve surprising speed when charging.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Generally peaceful unless threatened or during mating season. Herds are led by the largest female, with males fighting for mating rights through horn-clashing contests. When angered, their charge flattens everything in its path.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesStandard weapons nearly useless against hide. Target eyes, mouth, or joints where armor is thinner. Magic and fire more effective than physical attacks. Better to avoid than engage.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Venomwing Bat</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Flying Predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Caves and ruins<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate (colonies Very Dangerous)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>With wingspans exceeding six feet, Venomwings dwarf ordinary bats. Their fangs drip with paralytic venom, and they hunt in coordinated swarms. A single bat poses manageable threat; a colony of hundreds means certain death for the unprepared.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Nocturnal hunters that roost in dark places during day. They communicate through ultrasonic calls inaudible to most humanoids. Colonies defend territory aggressively, swarming intruders with overwhelming numbers.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesFire and loud noises can disperse swarms temporarily. Antivenom essential for extended exploration of their territory. Torches and bright light provide some protection. Never enter their caves alone.</div>
</div>

<h3>Stoneback Turtle</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Megafauna<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Lakes and slow rivers<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low to Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These ancient creatures grow shells wider than wagon wheels, often mistaken for small islands when floating. Moss and plants grow upon their backs, completing the disguise. Their beaked jaws can sever limbs, but they attack only when provoked.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Placid herbivores that spend most time floating or basking. Extremely long-lived - some specimens estimated at centuries old. Females come ashore to lay eggs, becoming aggressive during this period.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesShell essentially impenetrable. Head and limbs vulnerable when extended. Slow on land but surprisingly quick in water. Best strategy is simply avoiding provocation.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Stormwolf</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Magical Beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountain peaks and storm-swept highlands<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Where lightning strikes the peaks, Stormwolves make their domain. These magnificent predators crackle with electrical energy, their silver-blue fur standing on end with contained power. They run upon the wind itself, leaving thunderclaps in their wake.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Hunt during storms when their power reaches its peak. Highly intelligent and social, forming packs with complex hierarchies. Known to observe potential threats for days before deciding whether to engage or avoid.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesElectrical attacks can arc to metal armor and weapons. Ground yourself before engaging. Rubber and certain enchantments provide protection. They fear nothing and flee only from overwhelming force.</div>
</div>

<h3>Mire Stalker</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Amphibious Predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Swamps and wetlands<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Part crocodile, part something far worse, the Mire Stalker lurks in murky waters waiting for prey. Six-legged and covered in moss-green scales, they can remain submerged for hours. Their jaws unhinge to swallow prey whole.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Ambush predators of terrible patience. They create underwater tunnels and dens in riverbanks. During breeding season, their bellowing calls echo for miles. Will attack boats and rafts if hungry enough.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesNever enter their waters willingly. On land they are slower but still deadly. Fire effective but difficult to use in wet environments. Watch for subtle ripples that betray their presence.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Cliff Raptor</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Flying Predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountain cliffs and canyons<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>With wingspans rivaling dragons, Cliff Raptors rule the mountain skies. Their talons can pierce plate armor, and their dive speed exceeds any bird. Eagle-like in form but scaled rather than feathered, they carry off goats, deer, and occasionally unwary travelers.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Nest in inaccessible cliff faces. Mate for life and defend territory viciously. Hunt by diving from extreme heights, striking with lethal impact. Some cultures revere them; others hunt them for their valuable scales.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesNearly impossible to fight in open ground - find cover immediately. Arrows can bring them down if struck during dive. Their nests contain valuable materials but reaching them is suicidal without flight capability.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Burrow Wurm</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Subterranean<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Underground, loose soil<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate to Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Eyeless and pale, Burrow Wurms tunnel through earth as fish swim through water. They sense vibration through sensitive organs along their segmented bodies. Ranging from arm-length to wagon-sized, the largest specimens collapse roads and undermine buildings.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Attracted to vibration - walking, digging, or combat draws them. They burst from the ground to seize prey, dragging victims underground. Solitary except during mating, when multiple wurms can destabilize entire regions.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesStanding still may cause them to lose track of you. Hard-packed or rocky ground limits their movement. Fire drives them deeper. The larger the wurm, the more dangerous - flee from the great ones.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Phantom Stag</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Magical Beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ancient forests and fey-touched glades<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low (unless provoked)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These ethereal deer shimmer between visibility and invisibility, their white coats seeming woven from moonlight itself. Their antlers glow with soft luminescence, and they leave no tracks. Seeing one is considered an omen - good or ill depending on circumstances.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Peaceful unless their forest homes are threatened. They can phase through solid matter and disappear at will. Some say they guide lost travelers to safety; others claim they lead the wicked to their doom.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesDifficult to harm due to phasing ability. Conventional weapons pass through them unless enchanted. They rarely fight, preferring to flee. Killing one brings terrible misfortune - avoid at all costs.</div>

<h3>Barghest</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Magical Beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Moors and graveyards<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The Barghest appears as a massive black hound with burning eyes and jaws that drip shadow. It exists partially in the spirit realm, able to become incorporeal at will. Legends claim seeing one presages death - often your own.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Hunts alone, drawn to those marked for death or bearing great guilt. It stalks victims for days before striking. Some say it serves darker powers; others believe it is death incarnate.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesSilver and holy weapons most effective. Can become incorporeal to avoid attacks. Its howl induces supernatural terror - steel your mind before engaging. Running only delays the inevitable.</div>

<h3>Crystalhorn Ram</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Magical Beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountain peaks with mineral deposits<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These magnificent mountain dwellers bear horns of living crystal that grow throughout their lives. The horns refract light into rainbow patterns and are prized by mages for their magical conductivity. Their thick wool resists both cold and fire.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Live in herds led by the ram with the largest horns. Males clash horns in contests that ring like bells across valleys. Generally avoid confrontation but will defend themselves and their herds with lethal charges.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesThe crystal horns can pierce armor and shatter on impact, sending razor shards everywhere. Their charge builds magical energy released on impact. Best hunted from distance with bows.</div>

<h3>Nightstalker Panther</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Predator<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Dense jungles and ancient forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Black as the void between stars, Nightstalker Panthers are nearly invisible in darkness. Their eyes reflect no light, and they move without sound. Larger than common great cats, they possess an unsettling intelligence in their gaze.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Strictly nocturnal apex predators. They establish territories spanning miles and tolerate no rivals. Known to observe settlements from shadows, occasionally taking livestock or unwary individuals who venture out after dark.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesLight sources essential - they avoid bright illumination. Their dark fur provides magical concealment that defeats normal darkvision. Hunt them at dawn when they return to dens.</div>

<h3>Horned Serpent</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Magical Beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Rivers and lakes<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These massive water serpents bear a single crystalline horn upon their brow, said to possess healing properties. Their scales shimmer like opals, and they can grow longer than sailing ships. Ancient beyond measure, some are worshipped as river gods.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Territorial guardians of their waterways. They may allow peaceful passage or demand tribute depending on their mood. Angered Horned Serpents have destroyed entire fleets. Some form bonds with those who show proper respect.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesThe horn can cast spells and deflect magic. Fighting in water is suicide - lure to land if possible. Their scales fetch fortunes but harvesting them enrages others of their kind.</div>

<h3>Scorch Beetle</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Magical Insect<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Volcanic regions and hot springs<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate (swarms Deadly)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Armored insects the size of dogs, Scorch Beetles generate intense internal heat. Their carapaces glow orange-red, and they leave scorched trails wherever they walk. In swarms, they can reduce forests to cinders.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Feed on volcanic minerals and wood, which they burn internally. Attracted to fire and heat sources. Queens establish hives near lava flows, sending workers out to gather fuel. Swarms migrate when food depletes.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesImmune to fire, vulnerable to cold and water. Their death-burst releases stored heat explosively. Never fight near flammable materials. Frozen specimens can be safely handled.</div>

<h2>Dragons & Dragonkin</h2>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Lesser Drake</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Dragonkin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountains, ruins<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Lesser Drakes are the smallest true dragonkin, about the size of large dogs. They possess wings, scales, and a rudimentary breath weapon-usually fire or acid-but lack the intelligence and magical power of true dragons.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Lesser Drakes are pack hunters, using numbers to bring down prey larger than themselves. They are territorial and aggressive, attacking anything that enters their hunting grounds. They nest in high places and are fiercely protective of their eggs.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>A single Lesser Drake is manageable for an experienced warrior. In packs, they become dangerous through coordination and breath weapon saturation. Their scales provide moderate protection against physical attacks; magic is more effective.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Lesser Drakes are believed to be distant descendants of the Dragon Gods, diluted through countless generations. The temples teach that they should be treated with respect-killing them unnecessarily is seen as disrespectful to their divine ancestors.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Wyrm</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Serpentine dragon<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deep underground, ancient ruins<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Wyrms are legless, serpentine dragons that can grow to enormous lengths. They lack wings but possess powerful bodies capable of crushing stone and prey alike. Their breath weapons vary by individual but are always dangerous.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wyrms are solitary, territorial, and ancient. Many have lived for centuries, accumulating hoards of treasure and developing cunning intelligence. They prefer to lair in underground complexes where their serpentine form gives them an advantage over more conventional foes.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Fighting a Wyrm in its lair is extremely dangerous-they know every tunnel and can appear from unexpected directions. In open ground, their lack of legs limits their mobility. Breath weapon attacks should be avoided; constriction is the primary physical threat.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Some Wyrms are old enough to remember the Age of Silence and even the First War. Daring scholars have attempted to negotiate with them for historical knowledge, with mixed results-Wyrms do not share information freely.</div>

<h3>Dragon Turtle</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Aquatic Dragonkin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Coastal waters and sea lanes<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Massive creatures combining turtle shell with draconic head and limbs, Dragon Turtles are among the most dangerous creatures in coastal waters. Their shells can exceed fifty feet, and they can capsize ships with ease.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dragon Turtles are intelligent and greedy, demanding tribute from passing vessels. Those who pay are granted safe passage; those who refuse are sunk and eaten. Some negotiate exclusive contracts with trading companies.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir steam breath scalds everything on deck. The shell defeats most weapons. Fight only from shore with siege weapons. Better to pay tribute than fight - they remember those who try.</div>
</div>

<h3>Pseudodragon</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Miniature Dragonkin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forests and mage towers<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Cat-sized dragons with full wings and a stinging tail, pseudodragons are intelligent creatures often sought as familiars by mages. They cannot breathe fire but possess telepathic abilities and surprising cleverness.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Pseudodragons are selective about companionship, choosing partners rather than being chosen. They communicate through empathic images and emotions. Wild ones live in small family groups, hunting vermin and small game.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir tail sting induces sleep rather than death. They prefer to flee danger. Capturing one is difficult - they are excellent at hiding and escaping. Treat potential companions with respect.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Wyvern Matriarch</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Elder wyvern<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Remote mountain peaks<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Wyvern Matriarchs are the eldest and largest of their kind, having survived and grown for centuries. They can reach sizes rivaling true dragons, with wing spans that blot out the sun. Their venom has concentrated over the years into something nearly instantly lethal.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Matriarchs are the undisputed rulers of wyvern territories, commanding loyalty from dozens of lesser wyverns. They rarely hunt personally-their offspring bring them food. When they do emerge, it is usually to eliminate a threat to their domain or to claim a new territory.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>A Wyvern Matriarch is a flying fortress. Grounding one requires siege-level weaponry or powerful magic. Their hide has thickened over centuries, making them resistant to all but the most powerful attacks. Engaging one without an army is inadvisable.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The oldest known Matriarch, called Stormwing by the people who fear her, has ruled the Cloudpeak Mountains for over eight hundred years. Entire generations of a nearby village have lived and died paying tribute to her.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Dracolisk</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Hybrid abomination<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Varies<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Dracolisks are horrifying hybrids of dragon and basilisk, possessing both a petrifying gaze and draconic strength. They are thankfully rare, as their creation requires dark magic or extraordinarily unlikely natural circumstances.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dracolisks are aggressive and territorial, attacking anything that enters their domain. They seem to possess an instinctive hatred of all life, possibly due to the unnatural nature of their existence. They do not hoard treasure like dragons-they simply kill.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Fighting a Dracolisk combines the worst aspects of both parent creatures. Mirror tactics help against the gaze, but the creature is still dragon-sized and armored. Fire and cold magic are effective, as is fighting in complete darkness if the combatants can manage it.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The creation of Dracolisks was attempted by dark mages during the First War as weapons of mass destruction. Most died in the attempt; the few successes proved impossible to control. It is believed that wild Dracolisks today descend from those war-spawned horrors.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Sea Serpent Dragon</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Aquatic Dragon<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deep oceans and large lakes<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These serpentine dragons lack wings but possess fins and gills adapted for oceanic life. Their scales shimmer like pearls, and their length can exceed the largest ships. They command the waters as their land-dwelling cousins command the skies.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Sea Serpent Dragons are territorial but not inherently aggressive. They demand tribute from ships passing through their waters and may sink those who refuse. Some form pacts with coastal kingdoms, providing protection for offerings.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesNaval combat is suicidal - they control the battlefield. Their breath weapon creates crushing water pressure or freezing cold. On land they are weakened but still formidable. Negotiate if possible.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Wyrmling</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Juvenile Dragon<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Near dragon lairs<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate to Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Dragon young between hatching and adolescence are called wyrmlings. Despite their small size - merely horse-sized - they possess all the capabilities of adult dragons in diminished form. Their scales have not yet hardened fully.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Wyrmlings are curious, aggressive, and dangerously overconfident. They test their growing powers on anything they encounter. Most stay near their parent lair, but some venture out seeking their own territory prematurely.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesDo not underestimate them - they breathe fire and fly. Their scales are softer than adults but still resistant. Killing one guarantees parental retribution. Sometimes can be reasoned with due to curiosity.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Dragonborn Warrior</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Dragonkin Humanoid<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Dragonborn settlements<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate to Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Descended from dragons through ancient magic, dragonborn combine humanoid form with draconic features - scales, fangs, and the ability to breathe elemental energy. They stand taller than humans and possess natural armor.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dragonborn society values honor, clan loyalty, and martial prowess. They rarely initiate conflict but respond to insults or threats with overwhelming force. Many serve as mercenaries or guards, their reputation ensuring premium payment.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesExpect breath weapon based on their draconic ancestry. Natural armor provides significant protection. They favor direct, honorable combat over tricks. Clan bonds mean reinforcements may arrive.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Lindworm</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Lesser Dragon<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Swamps and riverlands<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Wingless dragons with only two front legs, lindworms are often mistaken for giant serpents. They are smaller than true dragons but far more common, lurking in wetlands where they ambush prey. Their venom is particularly feared.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Lindworms are ambush predators, lying in wait beneath water or mud. They attack anything they can swallow, including humans. Territorial, they drive away rivals except during mating season.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir venom causes paralysis and tissue decay. They strike from concealment - watch the water. No breath weapon but powerful constriction. Fire effective but difficult in wet environments.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Dracolich</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Undead Dragon<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ancient ruins and cursed lairs<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Catastrophic<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>When a dragon undergoes the same dark ritual as a lich, the result is a dracolich - an undead dragon whose skeletal form retains all its living power plus the benefits of undeath. These horrors are thankfully rare, as the ritual requires tremendous dark power.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dracoliches pursue the same goals as living dragons - hoarding, dominion, worship - but with the patience of eternity. They build cults of living servants and undead armies. Their intelligence exceeds their living form.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesCombines dragon abilities with undead immunities. Their phylactery must be found and destroyed. Breath weapon becomes necrotic energy. Flee unless equipped with legendary weapons and powerful magic.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Kobold Dragon-Priest</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Dragonkin Humanoid<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Kobold warrens and dragon lairs<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Among kobold tribes that serve dragons, the priests hold special status. Blessed by their draconic masters, they display more pronounced dragon features and wield magic granted by their patrons. They lead religious ceremonies and direct tribal warfare.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dragon-Priests are fanatically devoted to their dragon masters. They organize kobold society around dragon worship and lead raids to gather treasure for their god. They eagerly sacrifice their lives for their patron.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesExpect draconic magic - breath-like spells, scale armor enchantments. They summon and command lesser kobolds. Killing the priest may scatter the tribe or trigger suicidal vengeance. Their dragon will avenge them eventually.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Amphiptere</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Winged Serpent Dragon<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Jungles and tropical forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Feathered serpents with magnificent wings but no legs, Amphipteres are considered sacred in some cultures and terrors in others. Their iridescent plumage shimmers with magical energy, and they possess limited spellcasting ability.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Amphipteres are more intelligent than their bestial appearance suggests. Some serve as guardians of ancient temples; others hunt freely in their jungle domains. They communicate through a form of magical telepathy.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir bite delivers magical venom that causes hallucinations. They cast illusion magic instinctively. Feathers are valuable spell components. Respectful approach may result in parley rather than combat.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Half-Dragon</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Dragon Hybrid<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Varies widely<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous to Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Through magic or draconic shapeshifting, some creatures are born with dragon blood - half-dragons. They display draconic features grafted onto their base form: scales, wings, breath weapons. Each is unique based on their parentage.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Half-dragons inherit both dragon pride and their other parent nature. They often feel caught between worlds, accepted fully by neither. Some embrace their draconic heritage; others reject it. Many become adventurers or loners.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesCapabilities vary based on base creature and dragon type. Always expect breath weapon and enhanced physical abilities. They may have dragon-granted magic. Approach as individuals rather than a category.</div>

<h2>Elementals</h2>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Fire Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Elemental spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Volcanic regions, near great fires<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Fire Elementals are living flames, spirits of pure combustion given form and consciousness. They range from candle-sized to massive conflagrations depending on their power and the fuel available to them.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Fire Elementals are drawn to combustible materials and heat sources. They are not inherently malevolent but have no concept of the destruction they cause-burning is simply their nature. Some respond to those who show proper respect; others burn indiscriminately.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Water and cold-based magic are effective against Fire Elementals. Physical weapons pass through their forms harmlessly unless magically enhanced. Depriving them of fuel-fighting in stone environments, for example-limits their power significantly.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The faithful of Taninsam believe Fire Elementals carry fragments of the sacred flame. They are treated with reverence in temples of the Eternal Fire, where priests have learned to communicate with them through ritual.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Water Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Elemental spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Rivers, lakes, ocean<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate to High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Water Elementals are living water, able to take any shape from gentle streams to crushing waves. They are typically translucent, with hints of blue or green, and can contain debris or even creatures within their forms.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Water Elementals are protective of their water sources and will attack those who pollute or dam their flows. They are generally calmer than Fire Elementals and more willing to communicate, though their alien perspective can make negotiations challenging.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Lightning magic is devastatingly effective against Water Elementals. Cold magic can freeze them temporarily. They are most dangerous in or near water; on dry land, their power diminishes rapidly.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Taninivers faithful consider Water Elementals sacred, as they embody the cleansing and healing aspects of their goddess. Many healing springs are tended by bound Water Elementals who work cooperatively with the priests.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Earth Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Elemental spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountains, caves, anywhere stone dominates<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Earth Elementals are living stone, typically humanoid but capable of taking any shape. They range from pebble-sized to massive titans of living rock. They move slowly but with inexorable force.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Earth Elementals are patient and territorial, viewing time very differently than mortals. They protect locations that have remained undisturbed for centuries and react violently to mining or excavation in their territories. Once roused to anger, they are nearly impossible to calm.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Physical weapons are largely ineffective against Earth Elementals-they simply reform around wounds. Sustained magical assault can destroy them, and water erosion magic is particularly effective. Their slowness is their primary weakness.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Tiamats faithful revere Earth Elementals as expressions of the Steadfast Ones will. Dwarven miners have developed rituals to appease Earth Elementals before beginning work, asking permission rather than simply digging.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Air Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Elemental spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountain peaks, open plains, anywhere wind blows<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Air Elementals are living wind, visible only by the debris they carry or as distortions in the air. They can range from gentle breezes to devastating tornadoes depending on their mood and power.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Air Elementals are the most capricious of their kind, as changeable as the wind itself. They may be helpful one moment and destructive the next, with no clear pattern to their behavior. They are drawn to high places and open spaces.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Air Elementals are difficult to harm physically-most attacks simply pass through them. Earth-based magic can anchor them, and fire can disrupt their forms. Fighting in enclosed spaces limits their mobility and power.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Leviathans faithful commune with Air Elementals regularly, and the Floating Monastery of the sky priests is said to be supported by bound Air Elementals who serve willingly in exchange for freedom to roam the highest altitudes.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Magma Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Composite Elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Volcanoes and deep earth<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Where fire and earth merge in volcanic fury, Magma Elementals arise. These towering beings of molten rock radiate heat sufficient to ignite wood at a distance. They move slowly but with inexorable purpose, leaving trails of cooling stone.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Magma Elementals embody the patience of earth combined with the hunger of fire. They are drawn to large heat sources and may emerge during volcanic events. They destroy without malice, simply existing in their elemental way.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesImmune to fire, resistant to physical weapons which may melt on contact. Water magic causes them to harden temporarily. Cold magic is most effective. Never engage in enclosed spaces - the heat alone kills.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Storm Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Hybrid elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> During storms, especially at sea<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Storm Elementals combine air and water with electrical energy, manifesting as living thunderstorms. They appear during major storms and seem to be the animating force behind the most devastating weather events.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Storm Elementals are as unpredictable as the weather they embody. They may pass over settlements harmlessly or devastate them utterly, with no apparent reason for the difference. They are drawn to the sea and to areas of strong magical activity.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Fighting a Storm Elemental directly is nearly impossible-they are too large and too mobile. The Arcane Creed has developed calming rituals that can sometimes disperse them, but these require multiple casters and considerable preparation.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Sailors believe Storm Elementals are expressions of Leviathans moods-when the Lord of Storms is angered, Storm Elementals appear to exact his displeasure. Whether this is literally true is debated.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Ice Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Composite Elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Glaciers and frozen wastes<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Crystalline beings of frozen water, Ice Elementals shimmer with terrible beauty. They radiate cold that freezes moisture in the air, leaving frost patterns wherever they pass. Their forms are angular and sharp, capable of reforming when shattered.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Ice Elementals are methodical and patient, reflecting the slow movement of glaciers. They defend frozen territories against warming intrusions and may attack fires or heat sources instinctively.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesImmune to cold, vulnerable to fire and heat. They regenerate from ambient cold - fight them in warm environments. Shattering them is temporary; they reform unless completely melted. Their touch causes frostbite.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Lightning Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Air Elemental Variant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Storm clouds and charged areas<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Pure electricity given form, Lightning Elementals exist as crackling humanoid shapes of plasma and power. They move at near-instantaneous speed, leaving thunder in their wake. Their appearance during storms is particularly feared by sailors.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Erratic and energetic, reflecting their elemental nature. They are drawn to conductive materials and may strike at metal-wearing creatures repeatedly. Storms strengthen them; calm weather causes them to fade.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesRemove metal armor before engaging. They move faster than the eye can follow. Grounding them with proper materials limits mobility. They are weakened by insulating substances and dispersed by powerful earthing.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Dust Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Composite Elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deserts and ruins<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Swirling clouds of sand and dust that take vaguely humanoid form, Dust Elementals are the dry whispers of earth and air combined. They can disperse into seemingly nothing, only to reform and strike from unexpected directions.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dust Elementals are irritable and possessive of their desolate territories. They strip moisture from intruders, leaving desiccated remains. They communicate through scratching sounds and dust-patterns.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesPhysical attacks pass through their dispersed form. Water magic solidifies them temporarily. Contain them with barriers - they flow through gaps. Eye and respiratory protection essential.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Mud Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Composite Elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Swamps and riverbanks<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Combining earth and water into viscous form, Mud Elementals are amorphous masses of living mire. They can extend pseudopods to grasp prey and engulf victims within their bodies. Distinguishing them from normal mud is nearly impossible.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Mud Elementals are sluggish ambush predators. They wait in pools and mud flats for creatures to walk over them, then rise to engulf. They absorb organic material slowly, taking days to digest large prey.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesEngulfment is the primary threat - escape quickly or suffocate. Fire dries and hardens them. Cold freezes them solid. They reform from water and earth unless both components are separated.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Smoke Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Composite Elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Burned areas and volcanic vents<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Dark and choking, Smoke Elementals are the union of fire and air in their most suffocating form. They billow and coil with sinister intent, filling spaces with their acrid presence. Their touch burns like hot ash.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Smoke Elementals seek enclosed spaces where they can trap and suffocate prey. They are drawn to fires, feeding on smoke to grow larger. They communicate through patterns in their smoke and crackling sounds.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesWind magic disperses them effectively. Water creates steam that confuses them. Hold breath or have magical breathing - they kill through suffocation. Fire does not harm them but may strengthen them.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Crystal Elemental</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Earth Elemental Variant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Gem caves and magical mineral deposits<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Formed from living crystal rather than common stone, these elementals refract light into dazzling displays. Their bodies are harder than normal earth elementals and they can project focused light beams. They are found guarding natural crystal formations.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Crystal Elementals are defensive, protecting their gem-cave homes from intruders. They value crystalline beauty and may attack those who damage or steal crystals. Some can be bargained with using offerings of rare gems.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir bodies reflect many spells. Sonic attacks cause resonance damage. Light beams can blind or burn. Target joints between crystal segments. Their remains are valuable but harvesting draws others.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Elemental Myrmidon</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Bound Elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Summoning locations<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>When elementals are bound into suits of armor, they become Myrmidons - elemental warriors forced into humanoid combat form. They wield weapons appropriate to their element and fight with disciplined precision. Their creation is considered slavery by free elementals.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Myrmidons follow their summoner commands until binding ends. They fight mechanically, without creativity but with relentless efficiency. Free Myrmidons often seek revenge against their former masters.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> Notes<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> capabilities vary by element. Dispelling the binding releases an angry elemental. The armor contains and focuses their power. Target the binding runes to weaken control.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Phoenix</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Supreme Fire Elemental<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Sacred mountains and places of renewal<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme (if hostile)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The legendary phoenix is fire given life and purpose. Its magnificent plumage burns eternally, and upon death, it is reborn from its own ashes. Seeing one is considered the greatest blessing - or warning of great change to come.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Phoenixes are noble and wise, rarely interfering in mortal affairs. They appear during times of great transition - the fall of kingdoms, the rise of heroes. They do not attack unless profoundly provoked.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesEffectively immortal - they resurrect from ashes. Their flames purify rather than merely burn. Tears can heal any wound. Fighting one is pointless; earn their respect instead.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Galeb Duhr</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Awakened Earth<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountains and ancient stone formations<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These animated boulders possess crude faces and stubby limbs. They are among the most intelligent earth elementals, capable of speech and reasoning. Galeb Duhr can animate nearby rocks to assist them, creating small armies of rolling stones.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Galeb Duhr are patient observers of the world, often sitting motionless for years. They dislike being moved or having their territory disturbed. Some serve as guardians for druidic circles or ancient sites.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesIncredibly durable - blunt weapons nearly useless. They animate surrounding rocks as allies. Vulnerable to transmutation magic. Can be reasoned with if approached respectfully and patiently.</div>

<h2>Fey & Spirits</h2>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Woodland Sprite</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> <br><br><strong>Nature</strong><br> spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ancient forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Woodland Sprites are tiny, winged beings of pure natural energy. They appear as glowing humanoid figures, rarely larger than a hand, with features that shift between beautiful and inhuman.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Sprites are playful and curious, often approaching travelers to observe them. They are generally harmless but can be mischievous-leading travelers in circles, hiding belongings, or playing tricks that confuse rather than harm.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Sprites rarely fight, preferring to flee when threatened. If cornered, they can deliver painful stings and create disorienting lights. Harming sprites often brings the attention of more powerful fey creatures who protect them.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Sprites are considered children of the Groove Guardian, embodiments of the forests playful spirit. Harming one is taboo among druids and rangers, while befriending them can lead to valuable assistance in navigating wild places.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>River Nymph</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Water spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Rivers, streams, waterfalls<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>River Nymphs are beautiful spirits bound to specific bodies of water. They appear as idealized humanoid figures with features that reflect their home-a forest stream nymph might have green-tinged skin, while one from a mountain waterfall might appear crystalline.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Nymphs are protective of their waters and those who treat them with respect. They can be helpful to travelers, offering guidance or healing, but become dangerous when their homes are threatened or disrespected. They have been known to drown those who pollute their waters.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Nymphs can control water within their domain, creating currents, waves, or drowning pools. Outside their water source, they are vulnerable. Fire magic causes them significant harm. Negotiation is always preferable to combat.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Many communities have established relationships with local nymphs, offering regular tributes in exchange for clean water and protection from floods. Such arrangements can last for generations.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Dryad</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Tree spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ancient groves, old forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Dryads are spirits bound to individual trees, usually ancient oaks or other long-lived species. They can emerge from their trees in humanoid form-beautiful but clearly inhuman, with bark-like skin, leaf-like hair, and eyes like pools of amber sap.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Dryads are fiercely protective of their trees and the forests around them. They befriend those who show respect for nature and can be powerful allies to druids and rangers. However, they react violently to logging, fire, or any threat to their homes.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Dryads can command plants within their territory, creating entangling roots and branches. They can also charm those who meet their gaze. However, they are vulnerable while away from their trees and will retreat rather than fight far from home. Harming a dryads tree can kill the dryad herself.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The Groove Guardian is said to have created the first dryads to watch over forests in his absence. They serve as his eyes and ears, reporting threats to the wild places of Aedelore.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Will-o-Wisp</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Malicious spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Swamps, bogs, areas of death<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Will-o-Wisps are floating balls of pale light that appear in swamps and other treacherous terrain. Their light is hypnotically attractive, drawing travelers toward dangerous areas-quicksand, deep water, or the lairs of other predators.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Unlike most fey, Will-o-Wisps are malevolent, feeding on the fear and death of those they lead astray. They are patient hunters, sometimes following travelers for miles before making their presence known at the worst possible moment.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Will-o-Wisps are nearly impossible to harm with physical weapons-they can become incorporeal at will. Magic can affect them, but their ability to blink in and out of visibility makes targeting difficult. The safest approach is to ignore them entirely and navigate by other means.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Some believe Will-o-Wisps are the souls of those who died lost in swamps, cursed to lead others to the same fate. Others claim they are servants of the Void, weakening the boundary through the deaths they cause.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Treant</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Awakened tree<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ancient forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Treants are trees that have awakened to consciousness, able to move, speak, and act independently. They appear as massive, gnarled trees with faces formed in their bark and roots that serve as legs. They can reach heights of over fifty feet.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Treants are patient guardians of forests, spending most of their time standing silently, indistinguishable from normal trees. They only animate when the forest is threatened, emerging suddenly to crush loggers, fight fires, or repel invaders.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Treants are enormously strong and resilient, able to smash through stone walls and shrug off sword blows. Fire is their greatest weakness, and even the threat of fire can cause them to hesitate. They are slow-moving but can command other trees to entangle enemies.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Treants are among the oldest beings in Aedelore-some claim to remember the Age of Silence and even earlier times. Druids seek them out for wisdom, though Treants measure time so differently that conversations can take days.</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Satyr</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Fey Humanoid<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forests and wild places<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low to Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These goat-legged fey are known for their love of revelry, music, and wine. With horned heads and mischievous eyes, satyrs spend their days playing pipes, dancing, and leading mortals into trouble through their infectious joy.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Satyrs seek pleasure above all else. They charm mortals into their celebrations, which may last for days. While not malicious, their revelries can be dangerous - mortals have danced until exhaustion or followed satyrs into fey realms never to return.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir pipe music can charm or frighten. Surprisingly quick and agile. Prefer to flee or trick rather than fight. Iron disrupts their magic. Resistant to enchantments.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Hag</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Dark Fey<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Swamps, caves, and corrupted forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous to Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Twisted crones of terrible power, hags embody dark fairy tales made flesh. Their withered appearances hide immense magical strength and cunning that spans centuries. They delight in corruption, deals, and the suffering of others.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Hags make bargains that seem favorable but inevitably turn tragic. They collect debts, children, and souls. Often form covens of three, which multiply their power. They know secrets and trade in information.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesPowerful spellcasters with illusion and curse specialties. Covens share a hive mind and combined spellcasting. They prepare extensively - never fight on their terms. Iron and holy symbols provide some protection.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Brownie</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Household Fey<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Homes and farmsteads<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> None (unless offended)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Tiny fey standing no taller than a foot, brownies secretly inhabit homes and farms, performing helpful tasks while families sleep. They mend clothes, clean, and tend animals in exchange for small offerings of cream and bread.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Brownies are shy and rarely seen. They form attachments to families and homes, sometimes serving for generations. However, they are easily offended - gifts of clothing drive them away, and mockery earns their enmity.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesOffended brownies become boggarts, causing endless mischief. They turn invisible at will. Appeasing them requires sincere apology and proper offerings. Never threaten or trap them.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Nixie</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Aquatic Fey<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Lakes, ponds, and streams<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Water fey of ethereal beauty, nixies appear as lithe humanoids with green-tinged skin and webbed fingers. They guard freshwater places and can breathe both water and air. Their songs carry across water, luring the curious.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Nixies protect their waters fiercely but fairly. They may befriend those who respect their homes and punish polluters or overfishers. Some form romantic attachments to mortals, with tragic results.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesPowerful in water, weaker on land. Their charm can enslave victims for extended periods. Can command water creatures. Iron breaks their enchantments. Bargaining often works better than fighting.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Redcap</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Murderous Fey<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ruins and battlefields<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Unlike most fey, redcaps are born from violence and thrive on murder. These wicked creatures resemble elderly dwarves with iron boots and caps dyed red with blood - which must be refreshed regularly or they die.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Redcaps are pure malevolence. They haunt places of past violence, waiting to add new victims. They take cruel pleasure in murder and show no mercy. Their iron boots allow them to kick through armor.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesUnusually for fey, iron strengthens rather than weakens them. Holy symbols and holy water cause pain. Fast and vicious - expect ambush tactics. Preventing them from killing eventually weakens them.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Blink Dog</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Fey Beast<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Fey-touched forests and plains<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>These intelligent canines can teleport short distances, blinking in and out of visibility as they move. They resemble elegant hounds with golden-brown coats and knowing eyes. Blink dogs have their own language and society.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Blink dogs are lawful and good-natured, natural enemies of evil creatures especially displacer beasts. They sometimes aid lost travelers or those fighting darkness. Packs communicate through complex barks and telepathy.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir teleportation makes them difficult to hit. They coordinate pack tactics telepathically. Rarely hostile to good creatures. Harming one draws the pack ire. Can be befriended with patience and respect.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Korred</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Stone Fey<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Rocky highlands and standing stones<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Small, wild-haired fey with stone-gray skin and hair that is literally unbreakable. Korreds are tied to ancient standing stones and earthen magic. They dance wildly at night, and their rituals can cause earthquakes.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Korreds are secretive and territorial around their sacred stones. They punish those who damage standing stones with terrible vengeance. Their wild dances are invitations to join the fey - accepting has consequences.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir hair entangles and cannot be cut by normal means. They command stone and earth. Extremely strong for their size. Destroying their linked standing stone diminishes their power but enrages them.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Quickling</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Cursed Fey<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deep fey wilds<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Once lazy fey cursed by their queen, quicklings now move so fast they appear as blurs. They stand only two feet tall but can cross a room before the eye registers movement. This speed comes at a cost - they age rapidly and live short, frantic lives.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Quicklings are cruel and resentful of their curse. They serve powerful fey as spies and assassins. Their rapid perception makes them easily bored, leading to dangerous pranks and impulsive violence.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesNearly impossible to hit with normal attacks. They make multiple strikes before you can react. Area effects are most reliable. Slowing magic is extremely effective. They tire quickly during prolonged fights.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Banshrae</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Fey Spirit<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Fey courts and wild places<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Tall, gaunt fey with skin like bark and hair of autumn leaves, Banshrae are warrior-spirits of the fey courts. They serve as knights and enforcers, wielding weapons of living wood and commanding respect through martial prowess.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Banshrae live by strict codes of honor, but fey honor differs from mortal understanding. They challenge worthy opponents to duels and may test travelers who cross their territory. Insults demand satisfaction.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesExcellent swordsmen with supernatural speed. Their wooden weapons regenerate damage. They fight fairly if challenged properly. Iron weapons cause lingering wounds. Respecting their code may avoid combat entirely.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Erlking</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Greater Fey<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ancient forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The Erlking is a towering fey lord of the wild hunt, appearing as a majestic figure with antlers of silver and eyes of starlight. He leads spectral hunters across the sky, and to catch his attention is to become either hunter or hunted.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>The Erlking hunts the most dangerous prey - those who have offended the fey, oathbreakers, or simply those who draw his interest. Being chosen for his hunt is usually fatal, but survivors earn his respect and boons.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesDo not fight the Erlking. Flee, hide, or prove yourself worthy prey that earns release. His hunt includes spectral riders and hounds. Ancient protections and fey bargains are the only reliable defenses.</div>

<h2>Giants & Trollkin</h2>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Hill Giant</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Hills, lowland caves<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Hill Giants are the smallest and most common of giantkind, standing about twelve feet tall. They are dim-witted, crude, and perpetually hungry, with lumpy features and skin ranging from tan to muddy brown.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Hill Giants live in small family groups, spending most of their time hunting, eating, and sleeping. They are territorial but easily distracted-a sufficiently large or interesting meal can lure them away from conflict. They have been known to raid farms and villages for food.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Hill Giants rely on brute strength, swinging massive clubs or throwing boulders. They lack tactical sophistication but their size and power make them dangerous regardless. Multiple combatants attacking from different angles can confuse them.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Hill Giants are believed to be descended from nobler giant races, degraded over generations by isolation and inbreeding. Some scholars argue they could be uplifted through education; others consider them beyond redemption.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Frost Giant</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Borea, glaciers, frozen mountains<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Frost Giants stand over twenty feet tall, with blue-tinged skin and hair like frozen waterfalls. They are far more intelligent than Hill Giants, with a sophisticated society based around strength, honor, and survival in harsh conditions.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Frost Giants respect strength and directness. They will sometimes parley with those who show courage, though their idea of respect often involves physical contests. They raid warmer lands during winter but generally keep to their frozen territories.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Frost Giants wield massive weapons of ice and steel, and can generate freezing cold from their bodies. Fire magic is effective against them, but getting close enough to use it is dangerous. They often fight in coordinated groups, unlike their dimmer cousins.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>The Frost Giants claim to have lived in Borea since before the Elves arrived, surviving even Nyxoras attempted conquest. Whether this is true or boasting, they are among the oldest inhabitants of Aedelore.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Stone Giant</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountains, deep caves<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Stone Giants are reclusive creatures with granite-gray skin and the ability to blend seamlessly with rocky surroundings. They stand about eighteen feet tall but can seem shorter due to their hunched posture.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Stone Giants are artists and philosophers, preferring solitude and contemplation to conflict. They carve vast underground galleries and throw boulders not as weapons but as a sport, competing for distance and accuracy. They avoid other races when possible.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Stone Giants are phenomenal rock-throwers, able to hit targets at extreme range with deadly accuracy. In melee, they are powerful but less aggressive than other giants-they fight to drive off intruders, not to kill unnecessarily.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Dwarves have occasionally formed peaceful relationships with Stone Giant communities, trading crafted goods for access to mineral-rich caves. Such arrangements require patience, as Stone Giants think and act on timescales that frustrate shorter-lived races.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Fire Giant</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Volcanic regions, underground forges<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Fire Giants stand about eighteen feet tall with coal-black skin and hair that flickers like flame. They are master smiths and warriors, forging weapons and armor of legendary quality in volcanic forges.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Fire Giants have a rigid, militaristic society based on strength, craftsmanship, and conquest. They take slaves from other races to work their forges and mines. They are among the most aggressive of giantkind, viewing other races as resources to be exploited.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Fire Giants are immune to fire and resistant to heat. They wield massive weapons of black iron and can radiate intense heat that damages those nearby. Cold magic is effective; water attacks less so, as it simply evaporates.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Fire Giant weapons are highly prized for their quality, leading some to trade with them despite their slavery practices. The ethics of such trade is hotly debated in civilized lands.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Ogre</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Trollkin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Caves, ruins, wilderness edges<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Ogres are nine-foot-tall brutes, vaguely humanoid but with exaggerated features-huge heads, massive jaws, and disproportionate limbs. They are stupid, violent, and always hungry.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Ogres live alone or in small bands, surviving through hunting and banditry. They will eat anything they can catch and have no qualms about cannibalism. They sometimes serve more intelligent creatures as muscle, trading violence for regular meals.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Ogres are strong but slow and predictable. They attack head-on with whatever weapon is at hand-usually a crude club or their bare fists. A disciplined group can defeat an ogre by exploiting its poor coordination and limited intelligence.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Some believe Ogres are degraded Trolls, others that they are a separate creation. Whatever their origin, they are universally considered a menace to be eliminated rather than reasoned with.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Ettin</h3>
<div class="creature-content"><strong>Type:</strong> Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Remote hills and mountains<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Ettins are two-headed giants standing about thirteen feet tall. Each head has its own personality and they often argue with each other, making Ettins unpredictable and erratic. One head is usually dominant.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Ettins are solitary due to their difficulty getting along with anyone, including each other. They are territorial and aggressive, attacking anything that enters their domain while their heads debate tactics-sometimes helpfully, sometimes not.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The two heads give Ettins exceptional awareness-they are nearly impossible to surprise or flank. However, their internal disagreements can cause hesitation at critical moments. Exploiting these hesitations is the key to defeating them.<br><br><strong>Lore</strong><br>Ettins are sometimes pitied as much as feared-neither head is truly in control, and some seem genuinely tormented by their condition. Whether they can be treated is unknown; no one has tried.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Cloud Giant</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: True Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Mountain peaks and floating castles<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The most magical of giants, Cloud Giants have pale blue or white skin and live in castles built upon clouds. They stand twenty-four feet tall and possess innate control over weather. They consider themselves nobility above all other giants.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Cloud Giants are proud and aloof, viewing other creatures as servants at best. They collect treasures and curiosities, including rare creatures and artifacts. Some are benevolent rulers; others are cruel tyrants.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesControl weather and can fly. Their cloud castles give them every advantage. They possess magical abilities including invisibility. Pride can be exploited. Attacking their property provokes devastating response.</div>
</div>

<h3>Storm Giant</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: True Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Coastal cliffs and underwater palaces<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Extreme<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The mightiest of giantkind, Storm Giants stand over thirty feet tall with purple or green-tinged skin. They command lightning and waves, dwelling in palaces beneath the sea or atop coastal cliffs. They are the nobility of giants.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Storm Giants are contemplative and wise, often spending centuries in meditation. They intervene in mortal affairs only when great evil threatens. Their judgment is respected by all giants.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesCommand lightning and storms at will. Can breathe underwater and summon sea creatures. Their greatswords cleave through defenses. Fighting one is rarely necessary - they prefer to talk. When they fight, it is decisive.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Cyclops</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Giant-kin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Islands and coastal caves<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>One-eyed giants with a talent for crafting, cyclopes are solitary shepherds and smiths. They stand fifteen feet tall, and their single eye grants them limited prophetic abilities. Their forged items carry inherent magic.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Cyclopes prefer isolation, tending their flocks of giant sheep. They are not aggressive unless threatened or their property is stolen. Many have deals with local communities, trading crafted goods for supplies.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir single eye is the obvious target but well-protected. Thrown boulders and shepherd crooks are devastating. Some possess minor divination - they may know you are coming. Reasoning with them often works.</div>
</div>

<h3>Verbeeg</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Giant-kin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Hills and forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>The smallest of giant-kin at ten feet tall, Verbeegs are cunning and cowardly compared to their larger cousins. They resemble lanky, ugly humans and often work as scouts or servants for true giants.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Verbeegs prefer trickery and ambush over direct confrontation. They bully creatures smaller than themselves while groveling before the strong. Many serve as intermediaries between giants and smaller folk.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesMore intelligent than they appear. They set traps and use poison. Expect them to flee if outmatched, then return with reinforcements. Can be bribed or intimidated.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Troll Brute</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Greater Trollkin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Any dark places<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>When trolls grow exceptionally old and well-fed, they become Brutes - massive specimens standing fifteen feet tall with regeneration so powerful they can regrow from near-complete destruction. They lead troll warbands and claim the best feeding grounds.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Troll Brutes are driven by insatiable hunger. They dominate lesser trolls through violence and control hunting territories. Some display disturbing cunning, setting ambushes and raiding strategically.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesRegeneration even more powerful than normal trolls. Fire and acid still work but must be applied continuously. They can reattach severed limbs or grow new ones. Overwhelming force required.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Cave Troll</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Trollkin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deep caves and underground<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Adapted to life in eternal darkness, Cave Trolls have pale, nearly translucent skin and heightened senses. Larger and slower than forest trolls, they compensate with even more powerful regeneration and stone-like hide.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Cave Trolls are ambush predators, waiting motionless for prey to wander past. They have claimed entire cave systems, picking off explorers one by one. They fear bright light, which burns their sensitive skin.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesLight magic causes them pain and slows regeneration. Fire and acid still work. Their stone-like hide resists piercing weapons. In their home caves, they know every shadow and passage.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Sea Troll</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Trollkin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Coastal waters and underwater caves<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Also called Scrags, these aquatic trolls have webbed claws and gills alongside their lungs. Their scales are blue-green and they can regenerate even underwater. They raid coastal villages and attack ships.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Sea Trolls lurk beneath the waves, attacking boats from below or snatching fishermen from docks. They drag prey underwater to drown before eating. Some form loose tribes in underwater caves.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir regeneration works only in water - on land they are normal trolls. Fire is difficult to use underwater; acid remains effective. They retreat to water when wounded.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Fomorian</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Cursed Giant<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Underground realms<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Very Dangerous<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Once beautiful fey giants, Fomorians were cursed for their vanity. Now hideously deformed, their twisted bodies reflect their inner corruption. They dwell in the Underdark, plotting revenge against the fey who cursed them.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Fomorians are cruel tyrants ruling underground kingdoms of enslaved creatures. They hate beauty and destroy it wherever found. Their evil eye can curse victims with deformities matching their own.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir evil eye curse is devastating - avoid their gaze. Despite deformity, they are powerful combatants. They use enslaved creatures as fodder. Prone to rage when their ugliness is mentioned.</div>
</div>

<div class="creature">
<h3>Firbolg</h3>
<div class="creature-content">Bestiary entry by Aldric Shadowmark, Grand Hunters LodgeClassification: Giant-kin<br><strong>Habitat:</strong> Deep forests<br><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low (unless provoked)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>Gentle forest giants standing twelve feet tall, Firbolgs live in harmony with nature. Their blue-tinged skin and bovine features make them distinctive. They possess innate druidic magic and can speak with animals and plants.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Firbolgs avoid contact with other races, preferring their forest homes. They are peaceful unless their woods are threatened, at which point they become fearsome defenders. Some form friendships with druids and rangers.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesTheir nature magic makes forests fight alongside them. They can turn invisible in natural settings. Prefer negotiation but fight effectively when necessary. Harming their forest home brings the full tribe.</div>
</div>

They can assume any humanoid form and use this ability to position themselves for feeding on mortals they have grown to trust.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br>Oni are patient predators. They integrate into communities, earning trust before revealing their nature and feasting. They prefer positions of authority and enjoy the terror of betrayal as much as the meal itself.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br> NotesShapeshifting makes them hard to identify. They regenerate like trolls. Flight and invisibility provide escape options. Their true form is powerful in combat. Iron weapons prevent regeneration.</div>
